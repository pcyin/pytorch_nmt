now why does that matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the <unk> load of dolphins in <unk> bay .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
ak : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael <unk> called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : we were terrified .
here , craig is working the head .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
clay shirky , that great <unk> of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are <unk> giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only philanthropy that &apos;s <unk> itself , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
we worry that im , texting , facebook are <unk> human intimacy , but <unk> <unk> &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonomously drifting car .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
not a challenging task .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
her family has eight generations in a town called <unk> , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a <unk> in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
it always takes time .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
testing in humans is around the corner .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
this is in the early <unk> . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
we &apos;ve pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
so the fiscal cliff , i was told that that &apos;s too partisan a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called <unk> .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
none of these major theories have been completely successful .
the fear is that the world is watching .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
in fact , this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
now that thing , light <unk> across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that &apos;s done on the reflection .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
it wins or loses at that point .
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; thank you plato , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in <unk> temperatures .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
it was quite <unk> attended .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
exactly what <unk> means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per <unk> hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very <unk> and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
flowers will arrive by the <unk> .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
after they <unk> , they do rot .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
all across most land masses .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
this is extremely rare fungus .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have <unk> and <unk> fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
and everybody ran up to me .
<unk> , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people <unk> out a living there .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon .
this is actually in a <unk> area .
i had to think about how i sew and how i cut , but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room .
you set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you <unk> the culture , you injected the <unk> .
but it &apos;s pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
we looked at skyscraper construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing <unk> , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
however , honeybees are a minority .
if there &apos;s a cave in new york that had 15,000 bats in it , and there are 1,000 left . that &apos;s like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my <unk> .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> do and <unk> -- i thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and i won again .
this is very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was <unk> <unk> , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so i got inspired by that .
so again , this is 2005 .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in <unk> bags .
it &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
this is ted .
and that is the spell that i want to break .
now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
they &apos;re a sort of <unk> .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
that is what we have done on this planet .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
i really appreciated that .
now , i just do not believe that .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
that &apos;s the devil speaking . &quot;
so you are , in fact , a chord -- each of you an individual chord .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- <unk> hearing disorder .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
i &apos;m leaving you with a little more birdsong , which is very good for you .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what it has in the middle of it .
you guys are facing that way , so i &apos;ll hook it to this one .
and we actually sent this guy materials .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their <unk> and in their kitchens .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
trees <unk> <unk> .
that , i think , is movement .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn &apos;t recognize anymore .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
on that self , it should be centered -- a <unk> , a wholeness .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
this animal &apos;s fossils are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bored , they can go ahead .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
and the khan academy videos are there .
this is shifting and reflecting functions .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on <unk> ratios .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
is this ready for prime time ?
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
so on one occasion , when his <unk> were visiting them , he said , &quot; and who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
&quot; kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
they occasionally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully <unk> human eye .
for example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
there &apos;s something small there that responds .
it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
if we <unk> the double helix and <unk> the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged up and <unk> up .
one is <unk> up into one sausage .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition .
when the subject is still very <unk> populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority .
i &apos;m here to enlist you in helping <unk> the story about how humans and other critters get things done .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , it &apos;s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
there was a very nice correlation between love of lego and the amount of legos people built .
and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could have cheated .
people did not want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think about kids .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam smith was more correct than karl marx , but the reality is that we &apos;ve switched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict , because they &apos;re easy to bring into wars .
and my mother &apos;s vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible , she &apos;d given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
so i believe this kept me running .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
top right , <unk> has the same energy consumption per person , roughly , as canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you really want to get a lot from solar panels , you need to adopt the traditional <unk> farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too .
and a third option is nuclear power .
i &apos;ve tried it . it works . some people call it a lifestyle change .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
he is a boy from a <unk> in caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the san <unk> &apos;s junior orchestra .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
it &apos;s <unk> technology that &apos;s helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time .
how do you put simple disruptive technologies , and the first of five phrases that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
many people in this generation won &apos;t press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they don &apos;t want to bother anybody , even though they &apos;ve been paying 30 dollars a month .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and <unk> creations .
if you want your rivals to go offline , well , they will .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker , called evil hacker just for comedy value , <unk> something a little nasty .
there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
seven hundred and <unk> of you i could identify a hotel you &apos;d been to recently , absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and they &apos;re in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
so the <unk> dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
<unk> is really cool too .
a friend of mine , a colleague of mine , dr. hans <unk> at <unk> university , is actually looking at <unk> .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale . what this shows is a <unk> breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , potatoes that are <unk> imperfect , all going for pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . <unk> .
left to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
there is obviously einstein , <unk> <unk> , de <unk> &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james <unk> or richard harris .
and you can see how the icosahedron <unk> into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other .
what a handsome cat .
before the horse .
&quot; ten <unk> , 20 <unk> . &quot;
so , i said if i &apos;m going to put a circle , see what kind of patterns i get , boom , the red system .
you gotta be accurate ! there &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
there were only two other <unk> on the internet then .
i &apos;ll come back to that later .
i mean , everything off , it &apos;s like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
for example , if we &apos;d had <unk> 350 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive <unk> <unk> -- and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in europe .
in this context , when you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking , then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict .
it &apos;s just a big blue surface .
so if you ever <unk> about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that &apos;s what a dinosaur looks like .
he can &apos;t spin a web anytime ; he &apos;s got to pull his pants down first .
he never seems to settle on any particular girl .
so what i did was i made an adventure strip .
you really don &apos;t have to worry about the audience <unk> its sense of disbelief because , if you start with a talking shark , readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door .
so you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
my job description was <unk> vague : wilderness assessment and public relations .
what that means is , i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
audience : 25 .
audience : <unk> .
audience : seven . seven .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
audience : november . november what ?
of course , i could just make up an answer and you wouldn &apos;t know , so i come prepared for that .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
let me explain what that is .
i would love to talk about my astronomy , but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in <unk> transfer in <unk> atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
no , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
just two weeks ago i made -- you know , i &apos;ve been making small , medium and big klein bottles for the trade .
mentoring me . he &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
i take lunch hour .
right ? this is simple physics .
if you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really <unk> .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot;
so you &apos;d think , with all this extra space , we &apos;d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
it &apos;s time for me to let it go .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
north of churchill , <unk> , in october and november , there &apos;s no ice on hudson bay .
and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to recognize that i didn &apos;t really have a full understanding of it .
frank wilson had written a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
so what does play do for the brain ?
this took a long time -- i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and multiple <unk> , but as a couch potato , his brain has shrunk .
your own personal play history is unique , and often is not something we think about particularly .
characterized by a feeling of energized focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity .
how do you prevent either the media &apos;s interpretation of your work or the scientific community &apos;s interpretation of the implications of your work , kind of like the mozart metaphor , where , &quot; oh , mris show that play enhances your intelligence .
the difference between our <unk> and the other guy &apos;s <unk> , is that this is actually a dessert .
br : and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect <unk> , we really have something that looks , tastes and behaves like the real thing .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study <unk> man &apos;s impact on global warming .
alisa miller : the news about the news
and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they &apos;re just going about their everyday business .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
and no matter where i am , what &apos;s really going on here is that it &apos;s an <unk> system that tries to locate my eyes .
and inside it &apos;s got an <unk> robot arm that i borrowed , from a friend .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with hiv .
deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters stalk their prey .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
when we would get to these rural villages , though , what we found out is that no one had television , so they wouldn &apos;t recognize his face .
needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
you say what you &apos;re doing in 140 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those updates .
we built an <unk> interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
&quot; evan williams , give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at ted . &quot;
because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign , i had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which i could not personally identify .
all i had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
and so i began to realize that my american roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story , as had a professor , who once told me that my novel was not &quot; <unk> african . &quot;
start the story with the arrows of the native americans , and not with the arrival of the british , and you have an entirely different story .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
in a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to experts speak .
why was it that , when i had an operation , &quot; beware , ms. hertz , of <unk> , &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; watch out for a high fever . &quot;
my dad has alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and reading is just about impossible .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
so we &apos;re bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we &apos;re in in the u.s.
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
and if you really have a long day you can switch , and keep on driving around the island .
that &apos;s all the u.s. usage today .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
let &apos;s not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves .
the arguments of so-called id <unk> are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity .
now , the next one , &quot; the president of the royal society has been <unk> a strong inner conviction &quot; -- -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she clearly feels in a <unk> minority , but actually , how do american atheists stack up <unk> ?
i &apos;ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such history or philosophy , but i &apos;d be surprised if they were different .
darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia , but that ordinary people were not , quote , &quot; ripe for it . &quot;
when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word &quot; god , &quot; they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep , mysterious part of physics which we don &apos;t yet understand .
and it cost about 500 dollars to start it , which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today .
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license , they transmitted in an area , and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .
just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning , or , in places that are more involved , like wikipedia , gives me a certain set of social relations .
there are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 african countries .
the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it &apos;s inefficient and incompetent .
but what it immediately did was that the <unk> that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast .
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this .
he called these , &quot; massively fatal <unk> , &quot; meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
these drugs aren &apos;t cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence at least for those who can access them .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
it was a slow , <unk> process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
and , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the e. coli method i just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
the question is , why ?
you think the <unk> will put together a conference like this ?
there are certain things that we need to recognize .
now , the previous speaker before me , idris mohammed , indicated that we &apos;ve had <unk> leadership in africa .
by <unk> it off the backs of their suffering people .
traditionally , africans hate governments . they hate tyranny .
they decide what to do .
he &apos;s getting no assistance from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
and the man said , &quot; he &apos;s come down a long way , hasn &apos;t he ? &quot;
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i &apos;m kidding -- but these are the <unk> slides , and then i &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have <unk> purchases of <unk> .
again , the republicans here , this shouldn &apos;t be partisan .
one of the things that really <unk> me about the people in the gulf : they are really , really aquatic people .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
these tuna swim the entire ocean .
even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor , at least they shot back .
as far as cleaning them , i don &apos;t mean to cast any <unk> on people cleaning birds .
okay , people who say they &apos;re conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic , they would tell these corporations to go to hell .
it &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
all right : &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to chant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter .
and that &apos;s just a mouse brain -- it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human brain .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for <unk> of the brain .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by <unk> and reconstructing our own brains .
he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company , the directors bureau .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
ks : no , not yet .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
ks : now the way it works : there &apos;s a matrix of color <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he was still going like this .
i mean , his farm is incredible .
but he found this wild plant called the <unk> bush .
and then they circle around .
i finally got to taste it before i left .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what the hell does that mean ?
supposedly , anyway . i believe that one .
farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than imposing solutions on nature .
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts <unk> of the fossil carbon in the air .
our mobility fuel goes <unk> to automobiles .
don &apos;t worry about dropping it , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
already in about 20 states private <unk> will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill .
and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same , about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we &apos;ve got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal , or renewables that are more or less centralized .
so focusing on outcomes , not motives , can turn gridlock and conflict into a <unk> solution to america &apos;s energy challenge .
only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most <unk> children , <unk> new questions . is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
two years ago , on april <unk> , 2010 , i called my father .
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
we must remember , and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old , that life appears four billion years ago , around -- four billion point two ?
something like that . i am not sure of that .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
we have time to think , we have time to i don &apos;t know what , speak about art and things like that .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that &apos;s it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
we teach them how to go right face , left face , so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions .
let &apos;s get it all online . &quot;
it &apos;s predictable .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s good enough for government work .
and then you can support us . that &apos;s the role of you guys . &quot;
but i gotta have my hot dog .
they can listen and join the conversation .
take the travel service <unk> .
if you think of the concept of wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content , and at the end of the day you &apos;ve built the largest encyclopedia in the world .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
a page was created .
there was no leader .
extremism became tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
we can discriminate the sounds of our own language , but not those of foreign languages .
and we tested this by exposing american babies who &apos;d never heard a second language to mandarin for the first time during the critical period .
it looks like a hair dryer from mars .
if you look at science on one hand , science is a very rational approach to its surroundings , whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings .
now i &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
let me demonstrate this over here .
a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the rags were <unk> from a little girl whose body was massively burned .
it is there within every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
the wound is just filled with maggots .
suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ?
we &apos;ll start with a <unk> square and next to that put another <unk> square .
then there was aron <unk> , who was the <unk> .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
&quot; i didn &apos;t get the memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
so i went down to the lobby , and i saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : when asked about deception , he said this : magic is the only honest profession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
in fact , i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy .
but above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
these were money taken out in suitcases or in containers , in cash of course .
nobody wants the u.s. monetary authority to check their relationship , to monitor their relationship with their <unk> .
now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; hold on a minute . she doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean <unk> .
sure , i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what i &apos;d sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable .
and i really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really , really big .
but it was not without <unk> .
it &apos;s that little green sliver on the horizon , which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
we can start making better , wiser , more sustainable decisions .
<unk> savage : why i &apos;m rowing across the pacific
there &apos;s the world trade center site , on the front cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
it doesn &apos;t see any excess cost . it doesn &apos;t spend any extra time .
they were able to create that .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about making you feel good in places that you wouldn &apos;t have felt good before .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dismiss ?
turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by <unk> .
maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to <unk> , but never told , because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it ?
that &apos;s french science .
all right , here we go .
if you look at that truck there , it is the largest truck of its kind of the planet .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest-growing single source of carbon in canada , and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person .
and as a parent , i just can &apos;t imagine what that does to your soul .
in doing so , we &apos;ll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high greenhouse gas emission oil in the future .
the central <unk> of <unk> &apos;s practice is the ready-made <unk> <unk> that untold millions of indian women apply to their <unk> , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw is <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
so , i hope to convince you that complex doesn &apos;t always equal complicated .
the circled node is the one we &apos;re trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
for example , in my first tedtalk , i did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic <unk> in mood and long-term increases in happiness .
now , why a game ?
i mean , how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious , and in some cases <unk> , circumstances ?
there are four kinds of strength , or resilience , that contribute to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience , and you don &apos;t need a trauma to do it .
it gets stronger the more you exercise it .
here &apos;s one more secret for you : shaking someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos;s the trust hormone .
and it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
and then some people in chicago came along and they said , &quot; in late 2007 , the theme of the chicago humanities festival is global warming . and we &apos;ve got this 3,000 <unk> gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
<unk> and <unk> aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
and euclid said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ?
infinity . you all got it right . exactly .
so here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
and their individual visions , and their engagement with this mathematical mode .
and this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which i think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
tables and chairs and <unk> , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the <unk> skin response is flat .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom <unk> .
and my pain is being relieved . &quot; ok ?
he said , &quot; no , last three days , i &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no <unk> , no phantom <unk> pain , all those pains are gone away .
c sharp is blue , f sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
that gives you the clue .
which one is kiki and which one is buba ?
their sexual behavior is too <unk> for most of us to be comfortable with .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
good job .
he has learned that by using both hands and aiming his <unk> blows , he can make much larger , sharper flakes .
&quot; a frame &quot; represents a hut in the woods .
is he looking for where the sound came from ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion , leaving remnants like that .
on the right hand side , gravity holds <unk> . einstein explained that .
and more than that , it &apos;s <unk> new kinds of change .
he was premature . but he was a moral compass -- an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control .
but let &apos;s suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar , not just for 40 years , but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our earth .
martin rees : is this our final century ?
this is even worse now : &quot; then i &apos;d have a picture taken and dozens of <unk> made .
well these are college undergrads , so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them how happy they are again .
but enormously different motivations here .
so these are sales teams in belgium .
the teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they dominate the league by the time they &apos;re done .
today , when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric , we &apos;re oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those <unk> middle eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself .
ironically , this was happening at a time when iran was more interested in <unk> with washington than to see to israel &apos;s destruction .
this is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy , and when you eliminate diplomacy , you make war inevitable .
you can burrow down by a particular type of spending , or you can go through all the different regions and compare them .
the map of port <unk> at the end of 2009 was not all it could be , not as good as the map of california .
and here &apos;s the trick .
then to clarify , she went on , &quot; he was not an environmentalist . &quot;
this is a system that &apos;s designed to save the status quo , including the status quo of big and invasive government .
so it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . it &apos;s not .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we the people , and the republic we must reclaim
for example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of sputnik .
at least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot;
everyone is just a little bit mad .
i mean , i &apos;m not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it &apos;s not .
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
if you see fireflies in north america , like so many north american sorts of things , they tend to be independent operators . they ignore each other .
every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region , the <unk> node , which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep , have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down -- to send a signal to the <unk> to pump .
they were in sync for a while , but then they drifted apart .
so i want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day , who will describe what happened .
now , you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome , but after all , we do walk like -- i mean , we <unk> back and forth as we walk .
am : this one &apos;s only a couple of tons , so it &apos;s fairly easy to get going .
he was the most respected scientist in the field .
i wouldn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in <unk> order , and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother &apos;s maiden name .
the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that &apos;s not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we &apos;re going to need for climate change that the others don &apos;t .
we will watch children starve to death on tv .
the idea of svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so we get natural freezing temperatures .
and if anything happens , then they can come back and get it .
thank you .
you should care about your posture -- this is not right .
any lady , any lady ? thank you very much .
there &apos;s only been two concepts tried -- two by the u.s. and one by the russians .
talk very briefly about innovation cycles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they &apos;re replaced by something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because i don &apos;t want my competition to know my schedule .
what &apos;s out there is there &apos;s something really interesting going to happen here .
ok , we &apos;ll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s so frustrated he &apos;s ready to give up , but he has an epiphany one day .
institutions are becoming naked , and if you &apos;re going to be naked , well , there &apos;s some <unk> that flow from that .
now , the fourth meaning of openness , and corresponding principle , is about empowerment .
the toothpaste is out of the tube .
you know , bees come in swarms and fish come in schools .
there &apos;s a medical revolution happening all around us , and it &apos;s one that &apos;s going to help us conquer some of society &apos;s most <unk> conditions , including cancer .
this is a tumor : dark , gray , ominous mass growing inside a brain .
and you can see that the <unk> of blood flow disappears after treatment .
but the real question is : how well do these work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we added an extract from strawberries ; it <unk> inhibits angiogenesis .
but what &apos;s even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer , those who ate more <unk> of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer .
albert <unk> once said that , &quot; discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen , and thinking what no one has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m the puzzle columnist for discover magazine .
&quot; fun to solve , &quot; as opposed to everyday problems , which , frankly , are not very well-designed puzzles .
the background to one is the other .
well , you can &apos;t do that physically , but on a computer you can do it . let &apos;s switch over to the p.c.
i wanted to make a sequel .
which way will these fall ?
so , we got games like &quot; brain age &quot; coming out for the nintendo <unk> , huge hit .
looks like a black shape . so , where is that ?
i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we &apos;ve had to train everyone not to be that .
i remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent , used to beat me .
we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually <unk> them and turned them into commodities .
and she looked into her baby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there she was doing a ritual where she <unk> girls , who have run away , with their families .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i do not take things lightly .
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
so at the actual trial , all six of the teenagers testified , and indicated the <unk> they had made in the photo array .
but this occurred in <unk> , in the northern hemisphere , at 7 p.m. at night .
that &apos;s 30 feet away .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
he was a very religious man .
so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
and the <unk> in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; well , if i lived in the jungle , i would only use the long rows of straw because they &apos;re very quick and they &apos;re very cheap .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
we &apos;ve started a pilot program in ghana .
now , here &apos;s the bad news .
instead of turning to friends or relatives , they looked to david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile is used in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s sweeping into management <unk> .
getting over our fear of riding bikes . making our beds .
we &apos;ll set a few rules and we &apos;ll stick to them .
the conversation will go better . &quot;
just as i was leaving to come here tonight , one of my daughters started screaming .
and we ended up with 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and its famous opening sentence , &quot; all happy families are alike .
i &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
so if i put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that &apos;s protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it &apos;s dry .
plato in the cave with those very young boys . sweeney : ooh ...
let me show you .
but tesla &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
one of the things i want to establish right from the start is that not all <unk> wear cowboy boots .
we can turn it up or down , on or off .
so he is one of five kids .
i &apos;ve shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression .
we are now learning to understand what are the circuits , what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases .
really evolution works more like a <unk> than an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like richard , or a cockroach , or a crab , or a kangaroo , the relative leg <unk> of that spring is the same for everything we &apos;ve seen so far .
okay . the point is it &apos;s really hard to tell , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn &apos;t tell .
it uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it .
what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re taking that inspiration of the hairs , and with another colleague at berkeley , we &apos;re manufacturing them .
showed that , of married senior managers , two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
and we walk out , and we look at each other , and we say , &quot; how did you do ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi <unk> .
and i put my hand down , and i noticed all the women put their hand down , and then you took more questions , only from the men . &quot;
one woman came to see me about this , and i kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as much as they should , but they do it .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
but it actually hits home .
so i want to talk about , i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country , how we actually get information .
so it spells those out in very clean terms , and that works .
we tell you that you &apos;re okay , you &apos;re normal .
so this patient is in their 50s , so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is .
you do not need to have the education level of people in this room .
and that bee , no doubt , assumed that it had decided , &quot; i &apos;m going for that apple tree , i &apos;m going for that blossom , i &apos;m going to get the nectar and i &apos;m going to leave . &quot;
and when you &apos;re talking about nature , which is really my subject as a writer , how does it meet the aldo leopold test ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology involved here is this cheap electric <unk> : relatively new , hooked to a car battery ; even i could carry a <unk> paddock , set it up in 15 minutes .
when a <unk> <unk> grass , the grass is cut from this height to this height , and it immediately does something very interesting .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
if you &apos;re not , too bad . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come here at a certain time , get your drinks half off .
and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways .
and it &apos;s very powerful .
<unk> is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news , the most interesting stories .
we spoke to you last several years ago .
now you can also see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i won &apos;t shake the world too much .
you can see that it got started right here .
this is one of our engineers .
mendel , who was supposed to be teaching <unk> students , actually , you know , discovered the laws of genetics -- as a hobby , basically .
raise your hands .
it makes it a really fun place to work .
and so that &apos;s something we work on , and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now , and that &apos;s really their goal .
so thank you .
now , what brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory , they used the basement of one of their hospitals .
now the industrial systems of brunel &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
and just like brunel , by focusing on systems , we can have a bigger impact .
surprised by my <unk> , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
mark <unk> and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question .
yet that is exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for eastern europeans , the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a <unk> .
americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice .
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said that , &quot; it is poetry that is lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant shade of pink . &quot;
well , the three big problems have in common that they are man-made problems but they are controlled by natural forces .
so — thank you very much .
it &apos;s to replace competition by collaboration .
then what we want to do is create <unk> versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines , so we can go at very , very high speed .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood , not as a business cycle , but as a <unk> movement .
enter the atomic bomb .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and rub it out from the center to the corners , like this .
if you substitute the word blogosphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very <unk> now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
ph : i hope you realize how subversive that is .
eventually , the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company .
mm : because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
they &apos;re producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and whereas television may have gotten beat up , what &apos;s getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it .
he &apos;s a spanish architect and designer .
color can animate simple blocks , simple materials : walking in new york , i &apos;ll stop .
it gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we could all agree , and create some installations .
but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant , and almost an international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
and he said , &quot; well for one thing , there are more girls there . &quot;
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
he said she had one of the new , better chairs .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with <unk> that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position .
and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember which , i saw a reuters report that said <unk> had had their first cases of dengue , about 52 cases , with about 400 probable cases .
we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can &apos;t get the disease transmission .
so here &apos;s a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
so <unk> costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though i &apos;m an extensive global <unk> .
look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where you live
that is my grandfather .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
as i explained earlier , plants extract phosphorus from the soil , through water .
this is the cover of an extraordinary article published in nature in 2009 , which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
and instead of using a 100 percent dose , i &apos;m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
we have a technology that works , and one that , if used correctly , will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves .
and he was what you &apos;d call a <unk> : he looked at all of the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you can see that the components of this <unk> are repetitive , but they &apos;re repetitive without being modular .
now , as an architect , <unk> relationships is all i think about , but in terms of product design it &apos;s becoming more and more of an issue for companies .
we really approached it at the level of the <unk> of the building , where we could build these five separate towers , but they would all join at the <unk> floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass .
let &apos;s come back again a few years later , here in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like iowa than it does like a rainforest .
the difference is mainly <unk> the desert for food , or maybe golf courses in <unk> , you take your pick .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne .
we &apos;ve doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers , causing huge problems of water quality from rivers , lakes , and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss .
but we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet .
must work together .
so , what am i talking about when i talk about system d ?
we want our products in that store . &quot;
all of system d really doesn &apos;t pay taxes , right ?
and we interact with the physical world with our hands .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles .
and this is what it looks like .
and here we <unk> , or cut the nerve away , just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our <unk> signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put in an electrode and say , &quot; go there . &quot;
and that &apos;s where our goal is -- to have something clinically pragmatic to wear .
this is jesse , and he &apos;s squeezing a foam toy .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa largely fits this description , with 22 million people living with hiv , an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide .
local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries , ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors .
so the fundamental problems that we face are <unk> and too many people .
so they have all the criteria that people normally like .
and so you can see this current coming up -- in this case , the <unk> current -- that comes all the way out to the galapagos islands , and this deep undersea current , the <unk> current , that <unk> around the galapagos .
and also , we know that it &apos;s not only galapagos penguins that are in trouble , but <unk> and many other species of penguins .
so now i want to show you that penguins are affected .
turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his <unk> , we let him in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another fellow that will <unk> come by .
well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved : our basic political geography .
and they share a lengthy land border .
again , like mongolia , china isn &apos;t conquering russia . it &apos;s just <unk> it .
for poorer countries , china reduces tariffs so that <unk> and cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to china as well .
what i want to present to you is what i call state building , day by day .
these two arrows are an arc , an arc of <unk> railroads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and gaza .
a great deal of them .
so what is next ? what is the future of the european union ?
53 countries , and by far the most number of <unk> straight lines on the map .
this is a dream of the ages .
is it miserable ? it doesn &apos;t seem to be .
okay .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there &apos;s not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
you could change the genes in principle .
so it could be that the pathways that i &apos;ve been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the worm , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer .
you &apos;ll never see an ad like that because nike actually wants you to buy their shoes .
they all have heroes who were chosen .
it &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders , like prozac , act by globally changing brain chemistry , as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague , seymour <unk> , believed it as well .
so doing the screen , we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs , and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation , it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor .
now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans , but in flies we can actually test this .
either way , mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out . they smell us .
that &apos;s the cheese , just to show you .
in fact , people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos .
in the following year .
and at each time , i would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners &apos; eyes follow me .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
as we speak , there are <unk> or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country , venezuela , but in our world .
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
i can &apos;t tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it gets even better , for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it spreads its wings , it <unk> them , but it can &apos;t actually take off because the fly is <unk> between two glass plates .
now for an intelligent being like our fly , this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .
through many such experiments , we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just 12 cells .
there are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter .
this is libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of libby .
ed : all <unk> : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age .
and this is a picture of my graduation team from legacy .
and i tell you , this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game-changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime .
they don &apos;t stick by velcro or suction or glue .
here is the actual robot .
marc <unk> built a <unk> <unk> robot .
and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf , and there was some wind , or we shook it ?
so we did . and here is what it does .
completely opposite of the way you &apos;d see it on a nature film , of course .
we &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
and i would say , for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be , we would argue that they must be much lower .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic .
when that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
what caused it ?
either case , it &apos;s bad news for the corals of the galapagos islands .
their ratio tells us the water temperature .
but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black .
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere , we used to do it just with ice cores , but in this case , we &apos;re going back 20 million years .
and that is a task to which einstein set himself -- to figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity .
but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there .
and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns , these can also vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?
so , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
now , can any of you see the predator that &apos;s about to jump out at you ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true for information generally .
and we &apos;re going to look at that for about 30 seconds , which is a bit of a killer in an <unk> talk .
why ? because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics .
how do you know ?
and she &apos;ll come into the hive , find an empty honey pot and throw up , and that &apos;s honey .
he finds it . amazing . right ?
agreed ? yes ?
now there &apos;s often no right or wrong here .
2010 new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
well a couple of things : understanding of the security , of the risks , the threats , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face .
think of cancer , of bird flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new data , but there was less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias i &apos;ll call confirmation bias , where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that <unk> our beliefs .
i <unk> on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly .
this terrified people .
and it was found close to here , stanford .
they had good relationships with the teachers , students .
let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot;
and i assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and i could volunteer , but i realized no one was doing anything .
we opened the <unk> section in 2009 .
robert <unk> : building a park in the sky
and groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution bottom-up -- people &apos;s revolution .
and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising -- and for one reason primarily .
all of a sudden , ngos were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
thank you for your attention .
but i &apos;m not thinking &quot; <unk> &quot; is a good thing .
so , this used to be completely smooth .
now , it &apos;s kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know that creepy rich guy in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the <unk> come , they &apos;re right by the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit that i &apos;m a little bit nervous here because i &apos;m going to say some radical things , about how we should think about cancer differently , to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .
so i was like , &quot; okay . this guy &apos;s at least resourceful . &quot;
so we &apos;re actually measuring each <unk> as a different one .
if you &apos;ve got malaria , we give you <unk> or some derivative of it .
what we really need to get at is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s happening at the level of the <unk> actions , happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does ?
danny hillis : understanding cancer through proteomics
all of you are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
this is their lobby .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s most famous line was at stage three .
so i &apos;m going to sit here in my chair and not do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out , &quot; how do we survey the population of sub-saharan africa ?
we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward .
these one or two story structures , designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand , were not meant to be permanent buildings .
they understand the structural integrity of a deep <unk> lap , as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels .
but compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
and it is a most <unk> form of instant gratification .
i can &apos;t quite explain it , and he can &apos;t either .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us .
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit .
so that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
i &apos;ll give you some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without instinctively <unk> , mimicking their opinions .
so that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example in my own way .
okay , number two : go to the wilderness .
and , as you can imagine , if you can picture this : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in , unfortunately , very poor surroundings , and my parents did not have a college education .
and so , we believe that through all the changes that have occurred , that we &apos;re faced today with a tremendous opportunity .
it is an initiative that is focused on simple , accessible and <unk> solutions .
we have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands .
and on my wedding day , my father came to me again and said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m going to remind you again , that each generation has to do better than the last one .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i started it with one other family in 1980 .
do you think we have a stewardship here , to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four-year-old ford that i &apos;ve driven .
but that &apos;s not the good life .
that &apos;s what he <unk> .
whether you believe it &apos;s true or not -- it really didn &apos;t matter to me .
so , he &apos;s going , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
so , what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and that basketball represents your identity , who you are .
when my little kids were little -- they &apos;re all grown , now i have grandkids -- i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed , and i used to watch my kids sleep .
that &apos;s smaller than i predicted -- i predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number .
in a village , you have 100 laptops , each with a different set of 100 books , and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> area .
you guys are answering the question : how does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
and unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never <unk> .
the effect of this , of course , is it &apos;s not just amber waves of grain , it is mountains of stuff .
she came to this country in 1986 from vietnam .
and i &apos;d get a <unk> response : &quot; oh , that &apos;s worse . &quot;
our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average , and during that five year dotcom bust , we tripled in size .
bhutan , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the newest democracy in the world , just two years ago .
the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we &apos;re supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say i &apos;m standing still .
so amy , would you please come up ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
and i &apos;ll just read one .
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so i &apos;ve asked amy to be the last voice in this short story .
other people who are poor don &apos;t have those choices .
we &apos;re back where we were in the 1970s .
and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of <unk> not only hurts the species we &apos;ve talked about , but it even corrupts our own society .
now , 60 years later , i &apos;m here to tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure any of you have asked the question , yeah , are there great things up there -- what am i going to do , get up there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis system , and i got a lot of excitement around this , and i was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
i mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
you &apos;ve got a coil .
because remember dr. <unk> &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s cellphone <unk> .
and for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , which don &apos;t use <unk> , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t address the existing toxins in our bodies .
first , a burial suit infused with mushroom spores , the mushroom death suit .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; keep him alive if you can . &quot;
even with that <unk> paper in our hands , we just kept redefining hope .
it &apos;s a feature .
and suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
in order to do that , we have to put you as a user back in the driver &apos;s seat .
we flew the area . we imaged it . we sent in people . we took pictures of interiors , disaster areas . we helped with the first responders , the search and rescue .
by doing this i don &apos;t lose the original detail . in fact , i might be recording history .
you &apos;re being constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
that &apos;s not too good .
and which one is a democracy ? &quot;
the question there is : which country did better , china or india ?
because , as an indian man , you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis-a-vis indian women .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
china , i believe , still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals -- mostly the social capital , the public health , the sense of <unk> that you don &apos;t find in india .
it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds , different fields of expertise , and share .
and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries , and then it ends up being useless .
this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds .
about a decade or two ago , a wonderful scholar named howard <unk> went back and looked at darwin &apos;s notebooks from this period .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
in the 1970s , the one percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
a lot of these political factors can be broadly <unk> under the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political changes that benefit a group of well-connected <unk> but don &apos;t actually do much good for the rest of us .
but while it &apos;s pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy , what &apos;s a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it .
that &apos;s why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children .
we created the modern welfare state .
his is the little hand .
so one of these will happen to all of us .
so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us , because we thought this was going to really take off .
i actually think that , in places like oregon , where you can have <unk> suicide , you take a poisonous dose of stuff , only half a percent of people ever do that .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
but i &apos;d heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer , and furthermore , not only to cancer , but of metastases going to skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only <unk> percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
that &apos;s a very far-fetched idea , but i really believe that it may be possible .
and then , my translator left .
i noticed that at recess , she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team .
and i immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had an 11-year-old son .
and i said to the translator , &quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so , these two came to lunch , and we got thrown out of the restaurant .
he had kids from all over korea living there , and he would find families for these kids .
and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary .
so , i open the window , and i look out , and there &apos;s flames coming up the side of our hotel , and the hotel &apos;s on fire .
so , we ran to the bathroom , and got towels , and put them over our faces , and the kids faces .
like , what could you do for a year ?
this is her cooking teacher .
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a couple of days .
but there was no evidence .
there are small planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
there is a lot more work we need to do with this .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
and that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
thank you very much .
see , uganda coming down , zimbabwe coming down , russia went to one percent .
you &apos;ll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries , and yet you &apos;ll find senegal , down here -- the same rate as united states .
look here at kenya .
it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
we know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
this wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in germany .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
you just have to feed me . &quot;
he was wrong .
so i want to end with three questions for the future billions , just ahead of 2016 , when the united states will lose its place as number one economy to china .
no , we may hang on , despite the huge <unk> of debt that we &apos;ve accumulated , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical <unk> .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider silk is almost entirely protein .
there &apos;s quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make .
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their <unk> capabilities .
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself , charming though it is , but rather to these photos .
you have to have physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
and that sounds strange to our ears , but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a <unk> amount .
one of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the <unk> goal was to <unk> .
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots , trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists .
it was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools . and <unk> the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
you &apos;ve got <unk> , which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us , or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber , for the <unk> is fiber .
everything in its place . first stage .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question , &quot; what is it about bread that &apos;s so special ? &quot;
that &apos;s a transformation , two different things .
and as they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re raised again , all along proving that they &apos;re alive , and developing character .
and if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation .
it takes a long , long time to make these scores , and right now i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages in length , and it &apos;s just a big chunk of my life , and i &apos;m just pulling out hair .
this is actually being performed by brian <unk> , who is an extraordinary performer .
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , who was one of my students , and i -- was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
i mean , after all , if you look at babies <unk> , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the r &amp; amp ; d division of the human species , &quot; says psychologist alison <unk> . her research explores the sophisticated <unk> and decision-making that babies are really doing when they play .
and maybe , if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because , i mean , it &apos;s very , very trivial .
and you repeat that process over and over again , until you have something that walks -- in this case , in a straight line , like this .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
that &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
so , here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
several studios are using this software now to produce virtual <unk> , and they &apos;re going to hit the screen quite soon , actually , for some major productions .
that &apos;s what we thought was going to come out of this .
so this is about <unk> training -- as most of you , i hope , know .
but i must say , i &apos;ll never forget , when i was 13 years old , this happened .
i &apos;m making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .
if you ever are feeling lonely , get a new york times column , because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails . and the email i &apos;m getting a lot today is about frustration .
some of the stories are just so classic , and yet so understandable .
it <unk> . no one ever bought it .
so there is a limit that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the answer ?
this is microsoft word . when you want to create a new blank document in word -- it could happen !
but actually , i believe there are really two <unk> .
the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard , not apple &apos;s <unk> standard .
and conversely , if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say , &quot; piss off . &quot;
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for abuse .
and so to limit the danger of these new things , we have to limit , ultimately , the ability of individuals to have access , essentially , to pandemic power .
i think the challenge for us is -- i &apos;m very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
and if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a <unk> , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ 400 million fund , so this for us is a very substantial fund .
and if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly , you can use a more powerful force , a market force , to provide feedback .
until about a dozen years ago , when i was really captured by caves , and i really <unk> most of my research in that direction .
so , wonderful things and grim things .
there is sub-surface ice on that planet .
so they are , intrinsically , a slower <unk> .
in fact , there &apos;s so much energy available for biology in this cave , that there &apos;s actually a huge number of <unk> .
we can see them .
it occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past .
any time you have a goal , there are some steps that need to be done , some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mold .
and so before we could start imaging archimedes , we had to take this book apart .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
but as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip of <unk> had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because institutions at the moment <unk> their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
the original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine <unk> of the 18th century .
it was like , 160 dollars for this ?
it has four balconies .
a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan -- you &apos;ll start to notice .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
there was one object that i could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 cheval blanc .
and i don &apos;t -- call my <unk> a <unk> <unk> -- so it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean something that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i was not the only one there who had that reaction .
earlier this year , a virtual asteroid in it sold for <unk> real dollars .
the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .
now , i could make a game called <unk> , where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; right , well .
this is absolutely crucial , and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this .
and i want to tell you a quick story about 1999 -- a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games .
it &apos;s a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there &apos;s definitely hunger in america : 49 million people and almost <unk> million children .
and their farms are also large .
it &apos;s the <unk> anniversary of <unk> crops and the big <unk> , chicken <unk> , high <unk> corn <unk> , the farm crisis in america and the change in how we &apos;ve addressed agriculture internationally .
this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very <unk> statements .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &apos;t we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project &apos;s and the client &apos;s constraints ?
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .
and here is the fruition of that in <unk> .
the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house .
here it is in a flat floor configuration .
so i &apos;m going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
these are the images that are automatically constructed .
when i was awake , with the camera around my neck .
you can see a timeline , showing you the exciting moments throughout the story .
it &apos;s <unk> . moving on .
a <unk> cell phone shop owner .
an <unk> itinerant farmer .
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?
&quot; to make some money and to open a store &quot; was the indian road worker .
out of anesthetic , he had let them know that he wanted to be there , and he had given me about a two percent chance of living .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has certain advantages .
it &apos;s almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand , and then communication is limited .
very funny people , if that &apos;s what lol means .
you don &apos;t just zip right into it .
if somebody from 1973 looked at what was on a <unk> message board in 1993 , the <unk> would have changed a little bit since the era of &quot; love story , &quot; but they would understand what was on that message board .
i &apos;m overtime , so i just wanted to say you can , if you &apos;re in new york , you can check out my work at the whitney biennial next week , and also at <unk> gallery in <unk> .
afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a litany of astonishing optimism .
diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
and finally , we need to understand that in bosnia and kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our humility -- was the <unk> nature of our engagement .
rory , you mentioned libya at the end .
so , you see two examples here .
there &apos;s an example of the same thing on a finger , showing you basically what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , but if you look at the <unk> , they &apos;re for another kind of urine analysis .
the <unk> problem . that &apos;s a hard problem for reasons that i won &apos;t go through .
there &apos;s another very interesting connection here , and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system .
so , i think it &apos;s as low-cost as we &apos;re likely to be able to come up and make things .
and we &apos;ve decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there is a book written called , &quot; what &apos;s the matter with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .
but nevertheless , you &apos;re not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
so we can think more about things like street grids .
i joke , but i only half joke , that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb , no one will believe you till they get a cat scan , mri or orthopedic consult .
and bell then goes on to explain to the students .
so within a few years , in the late 1800s , early 1900s , all of a sudden , the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis .
there &apos;s a real <unk> between the patient &apos;s perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care .
i was also influenced by another experience that i had , again , when i was in texas , before i moved to stanford .
the bad news is we don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s causing this , but here &apos;s what you should do , here &apos;s what we should do . &quot;
i remember so many huge , hollowed out , haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed this ritual .
some people call us <unk> , which is kind of a negative term .
in this case , we tested it .
for those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; then a miracle occurs .
and it wasn &apos;t solved until <unk> .
religious <unk> .
it &apos;s getting the dead to talk back that &apos;s the really hard part .
but my friend , simon singh , the particle physicist now turned science educator , and he wrote the book &quot; the big bang , &quot; and so on .
now open your eyes .
you can open it up completely . it &apos;s waterproof .
but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys , at least most of them , know what it is that they do for a living .
and everyone said it was impossible .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
and it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo <unk> did not invent the <unk> middle and lower class of venezuela . he merely led them .
and around and around and around it goes .
they connect people to one another .
the reason ? today &apos;s current modern medicine is a <unk> technique .
however , there &apos;s a catch .
this makes it <unk> times faster , over <unk> times less expensive , and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection .
my experience , however , in the islamic world is very different .
so , for example , there is the character of noora .
and why does sex make babies , and babies spell erotic disaster in couples ?
because therein lies the mystery of <unk> .
and then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it &apos;s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no <unk> in desire .
it &apos;s the pivot , it &apos;s biology , it &apos;s the natural instinct .
that &apos;s the beginning of desire , that exploratory needs curiosity , discovery .
they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them .
other places around the country had similar rooms .
in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
okay .
these are played mainly in small rooms .
so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
thank you very much .
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; put her there ! &quot;
how do we solve these three problems that i &apos;d like to mention ?
albert einstein -- i was just talking to someone , when i was speaking at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s life all about ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
about 300 of them were there .
he put it on a personal basis .
a french historian said , two centuries later , &quot; seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he claimed to be .
i will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
but i &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
i never was pure .
harvest baby teeth .
with tears in my eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman stands before president <unk> and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war .
we go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space .
i failed to do this .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another <unk> girl , ghanaian girl , nigerian girl , ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage .
lg : you &apos;re welcome .
licklider foresaw computers doing all the <unk> work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making .
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
these records were human resource forms .
by implementing a superior process , what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours , all victories for human-computer symbiosis .
we should stop looking outside .
drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
because people say , &quot; bloody hell mate , i haven &apos;t got time to get fit .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i &apos;d anticipated .
these impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
think bike shops , juice stands .
in the <unk> era , we have still more in common .
you probably all have it , and if you haven &apos;t , you need to .
help me make green the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought , this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive card for my mom .
but actually i &apos;m sort of skeptical about this term .
in this case , you take a move block , snap it into a stack , and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story , in this case controlling the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
so as kids like victor are creating projects like this , they &apos;re learning important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the start .
what i want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think this idea of soul , as being at the heart of great cars , is very applicable . you all know it . you know a car when you &apos;ve seen it , with soul . you know how strong this is .
this is one of my favorite paintings , it really describes our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided that instead of , like , having a studio , and six or seven apartments , it was cheaper to rent elizabeth taylor &apos;s <unk> in malibu .
there was a whole lot of dialog .
and i think we felt much closer that day , we cut a lot of strings that didn &apos;t need to be there , and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
we didn &apos;t fly him to boston .
i have a small lab .
we &apos;ve completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that can tell us how to position this drug against the other .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy .
and so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but there will also be large fluctuations .
it &apos;s cooling off .
this is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
i had never used a computer .
it was the future i couldn &apos;t accept .
so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
i took it very literally , and took my bike helmet , put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that .
i &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
almost every year we have these <unk> , which are terrible .
we are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes .
so evolution &apos;s trick is to make them beautiful , to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them .
and some , in any event , are too big to use for <unk> .
our powerful reaction to images , to the expression of emotion in art , to the beauty of music , to the night sky , will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe simplify it .
so over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red led &apos;s on the driver so that you can see what &apos;s happening .
now let &apos;s see if mark avoids it .
or for the blind , everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting , in the office setting .
a subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that i did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
my mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination , verbal abuse , and physical and sexual assault , and i &apos;d been told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , you &apos;d be better off with cancer , because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia . &quot;
to paraphrase <unk> , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through at this time .
so , what i &apos;m proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life , rather than on mars , although mars is , of course , also a very promising and interesting place .
and the regular astronomers were <unk> about this .
because it means that -- the way life can live out there , it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet .
there was another object , this sort of <unk> piece of furniture with creatures and <unk> and <unk> -- pretty scary stuff , when you &apos;re a little kid .
and so the first projects were sort of humble , but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe finding some new functionality .
but the other thing that is humanistic about <unk> is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff , and all the nerdy stuff out of it , and try to make it as beautiful as we can .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the branding , it all becomes deeply connected .
but this is my <unk> , anthony , in switzerland , and he had the laptop for an afternoon , and i had to take it back . it was hard .
yves behar : designing objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman , was <unk> early .
she was the most determined advocate for women &apos;s rights i had ever heard .
look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face . &quot;
the world layma <unk> was given was a world at war .
then things get tense .
they have to negotiate .
they &apos;re the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is <unk> , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if you wonder why this is interesting at all , you have to see the rest of saudi arabia because it &apos;s a country which is strictly divided between the <unk> .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed .
let me give you an example : in turkey where i come from , which is a very <unk> republic , until very recently we used to have what i call <unk> police , which would guard the universities against veiled students .
now if i were the only person thinking that way , we would be in trouble .
in the 19th century , when muslims were looking at europe as an example , they were independent ; they were more <unk> .
that &apos;s why the e.u. process , turkey &apos;s effort to join the e.u. , has been supported inside turkey by the <unk> , while some secular nations were against that .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be connected to anything in particular .
today , a century later , when researchers want to visualize neurons , they light them up from the inside rather than <unk> them .
carl <unk> : how to look inside the brain
but this trend is less unambiguous .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine once put it this way , &quot; the <unk> on tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on wednesday morning . &quot;
yet instead of grasping this opportunity , local and international leaders soon <unk> and became distracted by the second <unk> , the events of 9 / 11 and the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
institutional design requires a keen focus on issues , innovative thinking and flexible and <unk> implementation .
stromatolites are the heroes in my story .
shallow seas nurtured life early on , and that &apos;s where it morphed into more complex forms .
<unk> covered continents . migrations got underway .
some mammals turned back to water .
every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury .
but there was nothing for this cause , so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer , and then we created our <unk> , which is , &quot; changing the face of men &apos;s health . &quot;
we had mo <unk> from canada , from the u.s. , and from the u.k. emailing us and calling us and saying , hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i say to them , &quot; last year we were fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors . &quot;
so those conversations , getting men engaged in this , at whatever age , is so critically important , and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise .
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grandfather &apos;s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
so when i think of that , i wonder what our grandchildren and our <unk> , when they ask themselves that question , i wonder how they will answer .
we need new models of being a leader and a human in the world .
she works with people like <unk> krishna .
over a lifetime , through everything , through the cultural revolution and everything afterward , he &apos;s kept collecting , so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary chinese history .
it just happens .
<unk> world &apos; is subjective .
or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock , staring at the sky and the sun and the moon .
and if you have lived an extraordinary life , you will be welcomed to <unk> , or what the french call &quot; <unk> &quot; -- -- the heaven of the heroes .
and so , you have these grand rituals where great images of mother <unk> are built and <unk> for 10 days ...
you see , what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves ?
you see , this is what india is today . the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .
you see , he has established the largest retail chain , called big <unk> .
&quot; why did i do the setting , why i don &apos;t care for the processes . just understand me , please . &quot;
<unk> <unk> takes an eye-opening look at the myths of india and of the west -- and shows how these two fundamentally different sets of beliefs about god , death and heaven help us consistently misunderstand one another .
but guess what ? this is almost 2012 , and saying to the world , &quot; i am totally , completely competent , &quot; is <unk> yourself with the <unk> of praise .
your interest is compared to what ?
your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery , and there , beside your <unk> will be a tombstone , and inscribed on that tombstone , it will say , &quot; here lies a distinguished engineer who invented velcro . &quot;
you are so happy . it &apos;s the conversation a parent wants to hear , because your kid &apos;s good in math , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next .
it is because you are — you know what you are .
i don &apos;t have any patents , and i &apos;ve never received any money from a medical imaging company , and i am not seeking your vote .
so how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies , so it &apos;s not widely used .
if you can find a tumor when it &apos;s less than a centimeter , survival exceeds 90 percent , but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases .
but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which profoundly influence that patient &apos;s surgical options .
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in <unk> the normal anatomic detail from the <unk> finding .
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later , and most women , thankfully , survive .
dum da <unk> da dum dum da <unk> da dum da <unk> da da that &apos;s a lot of power .
we gather together these physicists in los <unk> to see what they &apos;ll build .
mill .
you were sleeping during that class .
that &apos;s a stunning vision .
it &apos;s just a matter of the consequences .
so let &apos;s cut to the chase .
what did i do ? did i follow my gut ?
well that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way of thinking .
basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db will probably roll toward you .
i just do that to make money .
thank you .
and he told me , after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , <unk> , if people won &apos;t be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos . &quot;
this is the reason why i created , with david edward , a scientist of harvard university , an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , aromatic plants and so on .
it &apos;s a lot easier to be <unk> about other people &apos;s tragedy than your own , and i want to keep it in the spirit of the conference .
and in the words of malcolm gladwell , crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
ok , just like mcdonald &apos;s .
so for comparison &apos;s purposes , let &apos;s think about some other walk of life where you may expect might be extremely risky .
the other thing the gang was very , very good at was marketing and <unk> .
so economists talk about game theory -- that every <unk> game has a nash equilibrium .
<unk> is skydiving with a board on the feet .
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge .
ue : nope . it &apos;s just smoke .
i have occasional meetings with scientists .
so here i had the hope that by inserting some natural elements , if you want -- some fog -- i could make the space tangible .
negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .
the big mountains far away , they move less .
how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality , and also to collectivity , without <unk> the two into two different <unk> ?
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away .
but even more incredible was the footage shot from the <unk> submersible .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
at the time , he was teaching classics at trinity college in <unk> .
natalie merchant : singing old poems to life
and you can &apos;t get more alien than the dolphin .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with penny <unk> and koko , with sue savage-rumbaugh and kanzi , panbanisha , <unk> <unk> , alex the parrot , i got all excited .
<unk> <unk> : ng : speaking as one .
now , here at the national aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care , to research , and to conservation .
what we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together .
today . this is the first time you &apos;re talking about it .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag .
because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , <unk> , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , &quot; who &apos;s gonna see the show ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
this is not the <unk> . this is not my page .
and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; effort , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;d like to say with &quot; yes is more &quot; is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined , as who or what we are against .
and we saw this guy , <unk> .
gradually , you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life .
so if you come to the expo , go straight to the danish pavilion , get a danish bike , and then continue on that to visit the other <unk> .
it was kind of interesting because in the morning , from 9 to 11 , they were discussing the bailout package -- how many billions to invest in saving the danish economy .
it &apos;s actually a stand-up product from switzerland , because in switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators .
we quite often make little movies .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
but of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect <unk> to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something .
they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is <unk> . &quot;
second , china has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct .
freedom house finds that although 50 percent of the world &apos;s countries today are democratic , 70 percent of those countries are <unk> in the sense that people don &apos;t have free speech or freedom of movement .
because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create prosperity ?
the <unk> is not really in place .
we become what we really are interested in .
it just came out six months ago , and it &apos;s getting unbelievable traction right now in germany .
we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which <unk> me .
but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .
chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for ipods .
just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that , a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some people actually understand these things . you don &apos;t understand shit . &quot;
this is the coach purse that min gave me on the train home to visit her family .
the taliban now run their own schools .
if any child is found violating these rules , he is severely <unk> .
when i look at suicide bombers younger than me , or my age , i get so inspired by their terrific attacks .
and that will have to await the arrival , back at enceladus , of the <unk> , hopefully some time in the near future , specifically equipped to address that particular question .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line .
and that doesn &apos;t seem right .
and that data , layer by layer , gets passed through the machine , starting at the base of the product and depositing material , layer upon layer , <unk> the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process .
it &apos;s created depositing layers of about four microns .
there &apos;s a lower chance of rejection .
you can just make it physically on the spot .
here &apos;s the product being built .
without a doubt in my mind , i believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it .
he worried that if he called her by that name , especially outdoors , outside in public , he might be seen as endorsing bin laden &apos;s idea of jihad .
they use his rhetoric .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
but many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before . half the work is already done .
i was with my friend susan <unk> , the photographer , in the mathare valley slums .
and she said , &quot; you know , the poverty wasn &apos;t so bad . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all . &quot;
you think i will miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
the first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memorable .
but they &apos;re less likely to stick .
and my first year at caltech , i continued the business .
some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life .
solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
but they &apos;re also very high pressure , so they &apos;re dangerous .
that &apos;s a heat engine .
it &apos;s just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the <unk> and it &apos;s the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top -- this part gets hot , this part is cool , and electricity comes out .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it will cool itself .
this is the map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a <unk> to just use that up as fast as we are , i think .
we blow it up and look at the pieces .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i kept writing bad poetry , and he didn &apos;t blow up the math building , but he went to cuba .
so , good things come out of , you know , <unk> -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and i do covers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .
and then , &quot; be obscure clearly ! be wild of tongue in a way we can understand . &quot;
&quot; and decided his top people had to be <unk> . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody threw <unk> all over the staircase , and basically -- you know , i guess <unk> are a theme here .
and she dated george <unk> , so , you know , get out .
td : from the time i was very young , onward , i was given a lot of different responsibilities , and it always seemed to me , when i was young , that everything was laid out before me .
that &apos;s wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even in inviting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen , and i was somewhat resistant at times , and i was also very nervous throughout this week .
so in these two examples , we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation , and also machines that learned how to walk in reality .
when i say &quot; we , &quot; i &apos;m at the council on foreign relations .
but nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak .
most of the spending in the bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and <unk> threat .
we know the virus will mutate . it will be a different virus .
but actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from <unk> and coughing and what percentage is on your hands .
some of the poorer countries that have had the most experience with h5n1 have built up stockpiles ; they &apos;re already expired . they are already out of date .
and i think even those in the leadership would say that is the case , that we still have a long ways to go .
happy to take your questions .
and our centers for disease control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic .
and so far in the h5n1 cases in people , similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .
pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the <unk> that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco .
so please join me for a minute of silence .
i <unk> a young juggler in a juggling troupe , and he agrees to sell me three clubs .
now i have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood , so that &apos;s it . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m becoming a wire walker .
manhattan no longer spreads its infinity .
so you don &apos;t want me to street juggle here , right ?
i stop in the middle .
they had become one , pushing me to triumph .
because of the <unk> leaves and branches , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
i was interested , and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest .
we consult to the media about canopy questions ; we have a canopy <unk> ; we have an email <unk> .
and then the students would come into our sound studios , they would make their own rap songs with their own beats .
and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered <unk> in washington state and oregon .
&quot; look what they &apos;ve been hiding from you , &quot; he said .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
they &apos;re not magic . they are not our parents .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . &quot;
i learned two really important things that day .
now , the deeper you go underwater , the higher the pressure is .
so , this is how i began , about 15 years ago .
when you exhale your breath , it goes in the exhale <unk> : when you inhale a breath , it comes from the inhale <unk> .
any one of those computers can run the entire system , so if you have to lose two of them , there &apos;s also back-up power supplies .
but this is what it looks like , and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .
when we first found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family this thing belonged to , so we just called it the dr. seuss fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .
he had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned .
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super <unk> .
it &apos;s something like life , that once you get in it you can &apos;t get out .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s been dead for 25 years .
he had an enormous amount of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
these <unk> tell us that life may exist in many other environments .
so , one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos .
it &apos;s making silicon as important as aluminum , and we &apos;ll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging moore &apos;s law for more processing capability .
and then , we &apos;d like to augment the automated search with human insight .
it is the best place on the planet , many say , to study the history of climate change .
each cylinder is a <unk> of time .
as they handle the ice , in fact , they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven , so that , when their work gloves freeze and their fingers <unk> , they can don a fresh pair .
now , a bit of economic history , i think , may be helpful here .
and our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in <unk> when what they actually signed up for was to protect american citizens .
then you can go even further , almost <unk> efficiency with some operational improvements , double the big <unk> &apos; margins .
we could make cars bigger , which is protective , but make them light .
but they &apos;ll sell it to japan and china instead , because we have <unk> barriers to protect our corn farmers , and they don &apos;t .
that in creating the move to <unk> , low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials , or for that matter , <unk> <unk> that are a good backup technology , the military can do the trick it did in turning <unk> into the internet .
it can &apos;t just be a giant sexist conspiracy .
there are really two kinds of negative reviews that we &apos;ve received .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i turned the wrong way .
so he finally found an art dealer , a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , &quot; he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . &quot;
well , a good answer is , &quot; it depends . what is it ? &quot;
but how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
but i don &apos;t want a duplicate , even if i can &apos;t tell the difference .
so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington d.c. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
the second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it .
and as you start to read on , you can see that maybe there &apos;s some kind of political <unk> behind some of this .
she also <unk> that she &apos;s a certified professional member of the american association of nutritional consultants , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles .
the placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine .
and it &apos;s a foregone conclusion , if you give a drug at that high a dose , that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
and pretty soon , they began shipping that coal , ton by ton , rail car by rail car , <unk> by <unk> , back to china and elsewhere around the world .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
there &apos;s this thing , this <unk> of the world , and it &apos;s centered right in the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , they &apos;re just like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are nuts .
you &apos;re <unk> . it &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everybody else is chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said , &quot; dear , i &apos;ll be back later .
everything has changed .
now all of this has been tremendous for the world .
thomas jefferson , i think , really expressed this quite well .
for the hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than <unk> : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger .
but it is going to happen in this century .
that &apos;s not u.s. gdp per capita , which will be over a million , but world gdp per capita -- $ 200,000 .
moreover , as everyone knows , look -- it &apos;s energy , not oil , which counts .
my choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the gulf coast of alabama , on the florida peninsula .
we are living on a planet with a lot of activities , with reference to our living environment , done by faith and guess alone .
each has persisted for thousands to millions of years .
we need to settle down before we wreck the planet .
e.o. wilson : my wish : build the encyclopedia of life
another keystone species is a famous animal called the european aurochs .
the passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
de-extinction falls in that category .
real falcons out of slightly <unk> chickens .
the secret is , they have an <unk> program , which is absolutely brilliant .
so , this is an emotional topic . some people stand .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
and i &apos;d make my own comics too , and this was another way for me to tell stories , through words and through pictures .
and we sat in silence for that brief moment , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
celebrate your own style . don &apos;t draw the way you &apos;re being told to draw .
&quot; dear jarrett , i received your <unk> .
i &apos;m expecting the release of a chapter book called &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the frog who <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and behaviorally all the time .
this is a <unk> <unk> academy school which was built quite recently in the u.k. and designed by one of britain &apos;s top architects .
it &apos;s not just the children who are affected , though .
people who say , don &apos;t sit that team next to this team , because they like noise and they need quiet .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells the story of zero , a modern-day business man , going to work with his life in a suitcase , stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two .
three hundred and <unk> frames , four and a half years and commissions later , what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists .
i know theater unites us .
it is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent , meaningful and extraordinary work . it &apos;s now .
then if you look around you in the bathroom , you see lots more products like <unk> , conditioner , <unk> cream , body <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen from pigs -- has been used for injecting into wrinkles .
in total , i found 185 products .
and i said to her , &quot; well , your year is going to be long and arduous , dear . &quot;
and i gave them a saying to say : &quot; i am somebody .
you made me feel like i was somebody , when i knew , at the bottom , i wasn &apos;t .
they &apos;re now working on their ninth edition , which they began in 1930 , and they &apos;ve reached the letter p.
hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , polite requests , <unk> and threats so often veiled ?
one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language -- where it could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i &apos;m actually okay with that .
here &apos;s my argument . does it work ? is it any good ?
it makes it adversarial . it &apos;s <unk> .
what did you gain cognitively from convincing me ?
all these different roles . now , can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer , but you &apos;re also in the audience watching yourself argue ?
or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . we &apos;ll come with a design challenge and we find the champion <unk> in the natural world , who might inspire us .
that changed everything . from then on , you could not get these engineers back in the boat .
this is the opposite ; this is how we make things .
this is <unk> national labs .
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
sensing and responding : feedback is a huge thing .
you can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
my first business was a <unk> business i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
because , as the world economic forum noted , smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic <unk> .
and all around the world are not exceptions .
for this delight and for this wonder , people <unk> .
i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy <unk> local cows on my counter top , and i grab a paper towel and i want to wipe it up .
so first , we demolish it .
so what does this mean ?
and as i started looking at them , i was finding that they had <unk> .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they finally graduated and left campus , and -- glad to get away , i &apos;m sure -- came back sometime later , and found the crows still remembered them .
we found out they &apos;re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
squirrels , for example , would show up , look for the peanut , go away .
but there were three problems , three <unk> that i could not solve , and i want to share with you those problems , but most importantly , i think i figured out a proposal for a solution .
who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what might happen , because every region has something to offer .
let me connect the dots .
they know this is the mass audience of the future ; they need to figure it out .
this is far too simplistic .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of sound .
there &apos;s about 10 million <unk> per job .
and over here we have , in the words of radiologist israel <unk> , &quot; the hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling <unk> movements . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yeah , but you know i &apos;d rather finish my meal if you don &apos;t mind . &quot;
i said to her , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the <unk> monarchy , where there was an <unk> maria <unk> , who was having trouble <unk> .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i love it .
this just kills me , not because i wanted to use it -- i wanted to see it .
and that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
now up until that moment , i would have thought that , by age 50 , one of the life skills that i had really nailed was tying my shoes .
first of all , i have to say i &apos;m not from around here .
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t really seem to know where to put the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i &apos;d scatter a few things around the space .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
the song is just a given .
i went , &quot; wait a minute , all right , right -- i &apos;ll get the wheels . &quot; purely out of protest , i got the flashy wheels , and i installed them and -- check this out . could i have my special light cue please ?
now it seems simple , but actually i think in our society and culture in general , we have a huge problem with intent .
probes he designed , and in fact , he was really , really proud of these probes .
man , i love that thing .
the consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting .
he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat , really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge .
intent -- a life with intent -- lived by design , covering the original with something better .
i saw the healthy bulk of a left <unk> , and i <unk> that it was lost , <unk> all i had not yet done , but was now impossible .
i then began to wonder , as i had many times before , how my life would have been different had this man not injured me , had my genes been fed a different helping of experience .
i was me , but i was now me despite a limp , and that , i suppose , was what now made me , me .
i &apos;d hoped for something simpler : to exchange a turkish dessert for two words and be on my way .
he &apos;d served six months in prison , lost his truck license for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine perception laboratory at the <unk> san diego .
one , the perception of people , and two , the natural interface , the natural form of the interface , so that it &apos;s more intuitive for you to interact with the robot .
and yet , i &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own .
so having seen this danger to the economy , i thought , we need to find a solution to this problem .
or some even included references to the speakers , such as nathan myhrvold &apos;s speaking style , or the one of tim ferriss , which might be considered a bit <unk> at times .
i don &apos;t know any tedtalk that contains this .
this time i paid 25 cents because i thought the task was a bit harder .
but even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : the expansion must be slowing down .
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
the list of candidate shapes has <unk> to about 10 to the 500 .
and he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never succeeded , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because today &apos;s astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of <unk> informative photons -- a kind of cosmic <unk> billions of years in transit .
now , i &apos;ll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick , but it &apos;s a trick that actually works .
so remember , this is the first time you &apos;ve met him , and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious .
he said , &quot; go on , milo . squash it . &quot;
pm : that &apos;s dimitri at his most competitive .
we don &apos;t know anyone .
the next thing , the telephones go out , the tvs go out , there &apos;s armed men on the street , there &apos;s <unk> .
it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
so when people ask me how i continue to cover war , and why i continue to do it , this is why .
but my <unk> is to bear witness and that is the crux , the heart of the matter , for us reporters who do this .
so even before a target appears that she &apos;s supposed to cross with the cursor that she &apos;s controlling with this joystick , aurora is trying to find the target , no matter where it is .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
well , in an experiment that we ran a few years ago , we took this to the limit .
so , let &apos;s start off in china .
so dai manju basically finished out middle school .
hands up , please .
the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth .
she has become part of the solution , not the problem .
larry summers , when he was chief economist at the world bank , once said that , &quot; it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls &apos; education . &quot;
there &apos;s bill <unk> &apos;s book .
what that was was a bird feeder .
now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there &apos;s something worth explaining .
and even this picture has the suspicious <unk> of being rigged about it -- something from a <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups .
you put down your arrowheads and say , &quot; i &apos;d like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows . i &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of <unk> translators to anticipate all the <unk> possibilities .
but that doesn &apos;t tell us they necessarily had language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean , connecting north america to europe .
they flip the negative .
but through exposure to composite sketches , <unk> , mug shots and <unk> , eyewitness testimony can change .
larry <unk> served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in arizona for the <unk> and repeated <unk> of a 10 year old boy at a carnival .
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
and they actually shipped them here to texas for us .
and now you &apos;re riding along with the <unk> where it is right now .
it &apos;s just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing &apos;s happening .
this is called hooked on a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in part , we have the legacy of freud , who was a pessimist , who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest , is propelled by <unk> aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality .
and one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not <unk> of a single continuum .
and it starts in the <unk> <unk> area .
here is a <unk> baby .
now in the animal world , there is only one way to increase status , and that &apos;s dominance .
i end with a few quotes .
why would you choose rats ?
once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in <unk> .
knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
we &apos;re looking at neurons here .
so , this is important for imitation and emulation .
now , the question then arises : if i simply watch another person being touched , why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
my story is actually not about plant <unk> , but about pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope , actually in the lab at kew laboratories .
each of us , in fact , with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that &apos;s upon us .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
and right around that time , in the 1980 &apos;s , that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up , up , up , up , up , she wrote an editorial in the new england journal of medicine and said , the yentl syndrome .
and our colleagues in washington , d.c.
so we said , &quot; let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
so unlike the cat scans , x-rays , <unk> , for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart , every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation , we say , &quot; do we really need that test ? &quot;
okay , so here &apos;s where we started .
they have put their money where their mouth is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns .
the cells are kind of <unk> ; the dish doesn &apos;t feel like their home .
what does this mean for us ?
over the course of three years , we recorded eight to 10 hours a day , <unk> roughly a <unk> hours of <unk> audio and video .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
and finally , my son playing in a walking toy by himself .
three of the key people in this project , philip <unk> , rony <unk> and <unk> roy are pictured here .
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- captured on film .
and this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and , i also think , the better we can think and collaborate together .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall .
this is the first house i built .
after all , it &apos;s not just a question of hygiene , but there &apos;s a possibility of recreation as well .
so don &apos;t put it there .
so you translate that to the building industry , if we have a wall of <unk> and one <unk> is cracked , we go , &quot; oh , dear . that &apos;s cracked . let &apos;s repair it .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we hired on .
are we just being <unk> stupid ?
you can snap through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day .
so along about september they can <unk> in and go , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
what don &apos;t you do this , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver .
and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states , which has on it an eye of <unk> .
all of this is leading -- computer addiction , just to cover that : the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .
this is a very , very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system .
he then held my jaw in the right position while <unk> he put my teeth into correct alignment .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who &apos;s fascinated with <unk> gaps in consciousness , whether to restore hearing to the deaf , vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed .
now in the dark years that followed , i had to work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so when you get a chance , spend some time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had large families and they had relatively short lives .
and they are over here on this side . quite an overlap between africa and oecd .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china , and brought them into the mainstream again .
a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world . and what do we hear when we go around ?
but this is <unk> .
you know , darwin explained life after it got started , but what was the essence of life ?
and there i met francis crick .
but there was ones in the literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
i was decidedly unhappy ; a girl didn &apos;t marry me .
and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal <unk> versus cancer .
and so , i &apos;ll conclude by saying we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
first of all , if you can , don &apos;t fight the patent , fight the infringement .
my solution : award me this patent and i will troll them out of existence .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play , and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance .
this is a great technology .
there &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
so you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and as a result , we &apos;ve needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox .
it &apos;s been working to help control pandemic flu , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : well bruce , where do you think the toughest places are going to be ?
bruce <unk> : how we &apos;ll stop polio for good
dj : now we &apos;ve found these <unk> in all sorts of animals , in particular in the cats .
and surprisingly , it became a cult film .
and for us , in many ways , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us , a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work .
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety , protecting it from the hyena .
and of course , looking at this lion paw that has been <unk> , it <unk> reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic , because their fate is in our hands .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman , as a community and as part of this planet , and we need to continue that .
after all , it seems obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun small and mobile . but it &apos;s worth <unk> <unk> &apos;s remark on the subject .
and that &apos;s because in middle world , air friction is always there .
the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because there &apos;s no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement , the marble , as we see it in middle world , stays rock steady .
treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate , but it &apos;s a <unk> waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
overnight , i became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40 .
using a mouse cursor i control with my head , these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
for example , in oceanography , a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the <unk> beams that the dolphins emit .
i think collectively we can build a global community .
it &apos;s been a major trending topic .
now there &apos;s a couple -- there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
but generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
i think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
that &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we have to solve .
i &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
what are they looking at ? maybe we should be looking at it .
and when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; why would i conceivably care about this ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
they would bring prosperity , security , overcome sectarian violence , ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists .
and part of that activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day .
<unk> sen , who &apos;s this guy : i would have made this money , too , but i &apos;ve spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the <unk> -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso &apos;s chicken , which actually started in new york city in the early 1970s , as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the seventeenth , eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than <unk> that &apos;ll do the trick .
so people would have a real grand <unk> seizure .
as my referrals began to decrease , i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember when you were a kid , and you had to step on every line ?
by 18 and 19 , i was sleeping through the night .
every once in a while , i get somewhat depressed and a little <unk> .
there is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world .
and he &apos;s going around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know ? where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes , as well as the potential for climate change ?
by tackling the impossible , you make the impossible possible .
but we did get an agreement on climate change .
and god cried .
the silk worm does a remarkable thing : it uses these two ingredients , protein and water , that are in its gland , to make a material that is <unk> tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like kevlar .
or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make .
and you see there , it gets <unk> in tissue .
with my new venture , marilyn <unk> , i would like to use art to create tech .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and <unk> -- i hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions .
what can i do ? &quot;
in this <unk> demo , heather knight introduces data , a robotic stand-up comedian that does much more than <unk> off <unk> -- it gathers audience feedback and tunes its act as the crowd responds . is this thing on ?
stanley milgram from the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , the creator of the <unk> experiments , which became later popularized as six degrees of separation , made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps .
how might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people ?
there was , however , an incident i &apos;m going to tell you about , that perhaps could have led me suspect something .
my father , a secret agent ?
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
this sense of responsibility for other people &apos;s lives when he was just 17 -- and also his guilt for being a survivor , since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life .
and while my half brother and sister thought they &apos;d been abandoned , orphaned , my father was making false papers .
i asked him whether , considering the sacrifices he had to make , he ever had any regrets .
we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic -- a beautiful system -- a regulating <unk> at the planetary level , taking the knock after knock on climate change , appearing to be in a good state .
you degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
but of course , the drama is , it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option .
that led me to another step of why i &apos;m here today , is because i really liked media of all kinds .
is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of <unk> .
first , he got an age-old way of making it , which was relief , and he worked this with <unk> perspective , which was brand-new technology at the time .
and by manipulating sugar over a black paper , i made portraits of them .
they end up being very large pictures , and i photographed with a very large camera -- an <unk> camera .
my interest in acting , especially bad acting , goes a long way .
farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
but we can then ask : are there any absolute differences between africans and <unk> ?
and you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today .
so we can then ask for denisovans the same things as for the neanderthals : did they mix with ancestors of present day people ?
there are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future , for instance , this vision here from the early 20th century .
my belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness .
so imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a 3d printer , and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic , and follow the forces which occur in your component .
they didn &apos;t talk . but most of all , they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
you would <unk> . you would call the police .
well , now we know it &apos;s more like one in 100 .
you &apos;re watching a video .
there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities , preventing , in fact , those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field .
then you take off .
the first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest , your arms extended , put over your reserve parachute .
they &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an &quot; after action review &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
also , the people had changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was , as it related , for her , to the idea of how black people had been represented .
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m asking .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
so the children said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
they are trying to multiply , i think .
so i said , &quot; well , how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing ? &quot;
the scores went up to 50 , which is what the <unk> schools of new delhi , with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting .
when i did the experiment , when i did the test , after two months , the score was 76 percent .
after watching eight tedtalks , he wants to become leonardo da vinci .
these are 10 year-olds .
and all of a sudden , out of the dark , from the other end of the square , i saw the <unk> of mirrors lit by the moon .
if i were to reduce this entire story into one image , what would it be ? &quot;
so now i &apos;m going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year , &quot; the tempest . &quot;
and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are in africa .
it &apos;s another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise .
let &apos;s use the market as the best listening device we have , and understand at what price people would pay for this , so they get the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the rule of thumb was that , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two <unk> and 10 televisions in the process .
the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that &apos;s a problem .
that one &apos;s pretty good . it &apos;s getting better .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models i work with .
generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece , and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery .
thank you .
trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the <unk> end forward . it was a tough job , and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature .
but now let &apos;s look at the other end .
we &apos;re working on projects now -- even <unk> things the size of <unk> <unk> -- darpa contracts , working with caltech , ucla .
so , be gentle , just act like a wooden indian or something .
now i wasn &apos;t trying to be smart .
they keep going on forever .
it &apos;s over two billion .
it took him , by his estimate , &quot; three years of sundays . &quot;
don &apos;t forget to <unk> the one .
but for me it &apos;s amazing because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time in which we live , when human minds and machines can conquer together .
i &apos;ve clearly got mass . where does it come from ?
and in fact , there &apos;s concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus .
so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from jonas &apos; tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body .
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .
so just finally , cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
and that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy .
but they didn &apos;t think that those numbers were related to them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the average amount of bias that we see .
but the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion .
what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world &apos;s population and more than half of the world &apos;s product .
you might think of that as the privatization of war .
in 1958 , after the soviets put up sputnik , it was &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in <unk> , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in beijing .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we &apos;re going to be able to manage this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just zero sum , but positive sum .
so that &apos;s the conventional approach .
the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .
and they are interdependent over a long term .
jobs for whom ? especially jobs for young men .
often the legal system is broken down so you can &apos;t even get access to land .
they would be <unk> as being done by the post-conflict government , in the country .
this is the skyline of my hometown , new orleans .
the military gets it . they call climate change a threat <unk> that could harm stability and security , while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond .
it &apos;s allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time , without assistance .
i think these are inspiring examples of what &apos;s possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different .
listen as chinese students practice their english by screaming it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification , introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent , and also taking the hypothetical seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is .
luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to <unk> the concrete world .
and luria said , &quot; at the north pole , there is always snow .
they put it in <unk> rather than new york .
so it hasn &apos;t just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you deserve to be killed ?
they could say a <unk> .
it feels like i &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and so they <unk> with me to get a degree in something .
now it &apos;s still in debt , but chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
i am one of her teaching gestures .
there &apos;s a prime minister , secretary of state , minister of defense and a cfo , or <unk> .
boy : the world peace game is serious .
we were all upset with her , &quot; why are you doing this ?
it &apos;ll be more <unk> if she reads it . &quot;
we had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the <unk> crises .
and we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
lots of people resigned from <unk> jobs and jumped into the national movement .
it &apos;s like its own little <unk> .
and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three <unk> of this triangle , i would make a tetrahedron .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; this filling cap will go very <unk> into an old bicycle tube .
and this can be , if you had a whole <unk> paper -- <unk> size paper -- you could be in a municipal school , you could be in a government school -- a paper , a scale and a pencil -- no glue , no scissors .
what we do is make a very simple electric motor .
this is a little straw , and what you do is you just <unk> two corners here , and this becomes like a baby crocodile &apos;s mouth .
these are two magnets .
and there were lots of passengers on the ship , and they were getting bored , so the captain invited them on the deck .
at the ink conference , <unk> gupta shares simple yet stunning plans for turning trash into seriously entertaining , well-designed toys that kids can build themselves -- while learning basic principles of science and design .
it was a hell of a challenge , and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues .
and there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems .
and with just a little bit of planning , we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people , <unk> people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities .
this photograph was taken on completion day , and just one year later , it looked like that .
when you evaporate seawater , the first thing to <unk> out is calcium carbonate .
no , you need to set people &apos;s souls <unk> with visions of exploring distant shores . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who was jewish , because that &apos;s what i am and that was important to me .
but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date .
very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves .
he likes to travel as long as it doesn &apos;t involve a cruise ship .
what i was trying to get at here was as a <unk> .
because remember , in my scoring system , they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points , and none of them have done that .
most of you . the average age of a gamer is 33 years old , not eight years old , and in fact , if we look at the projected demographics of video game play , the video game players of tomorrow are older adults .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
actually , those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world .
now i &apos;d like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much revered by society , which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking .
so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just run all possible programs of the particular type that we &apos;re looking at .
so , it &apos;s been a big , very complex project , which i was not sure was going to work at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its sort of precise , formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
so , with physical materials , we &apos;re used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity , and even general relativity and gravitation , and at least give hints of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think so .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv / aids .
they jump high . they wear red .
because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by default , everything in my family anyway belongs to my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep .
they were sneakers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have paved roads . it was quite attractive .
i promised him that i would be the best girl , i will come back , anything they wanted after that , i will do it for them .
if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she &apos;s punished .
as we speak right now , 125 girls will never be mutilated .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the gdp of america have actually started , just like banks and just like businesses , to <unk> , to <unk> their leverage , in daily life , to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
<unk> are up 48 percent , according to the cornell institute .
we also see the trend toward tourism that &apos;s a little bit more low key . right ?
one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods , and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system .
we also see a big diy movement .
the artisanal movement is huge .
then you look at the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then my question became , am i the only one who does this ?
you could abuse it .
that &apos;s what i do in life -- telling stories , writing novels -- and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the <unk> .
our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might <unk> , and our <unk> might <unk> if we stay for too long inside our cultural <unk> .
it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the &quot; representative foreigner . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile -- they ask me why i do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
my micro story became a macro issue when i was prosecuted .
literature has to take us beyond .
i might write about a muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a handsome , gay professor in norway .
it &apos;s how you remix . you take existing songs , you chop them up , you transform the pieces , you combine them back together again , and you &apos;ve got a new song , but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property .
it &apos;s a <unk> software patent , but i will summarize what it covers . <unk> alert : unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger .
our creativity comes from without , not from within .
and you say then , &quot; ok , then how do you know your home address ? &quot;
but actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , <unk> of almost smoke rising up from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that &apos;s explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them .
this is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; our garden &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our sun in it .
it can also , i think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s us .
and with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen , we are like <unk> and <unk> leaving <unk> of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods .
our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table , and i asked her , &quot; is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school ? &quot;
we can &apos;t sit <unk> by here either .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and so , on my 27th birthday i decided , because i argued so much and i talk so much , that i was going to stop speaking for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest .
you don &apos;t <unk> ?
i explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that i was john francis , i was walking around the world , i didn &apos;t talk and this was the last time this person &apos;s going to be here interpreting for me .
well , i put on my backpack again .
i started talking because i had studied environment .
but the thing that was different was that every birthday , i asked myself about silence , but i never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
i was born and raised in north korea .
sometimes , i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was always worried about being caught and sent back .
i felt so <unk> that i had so much food in america , yet my father died of starvation .
but i confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other <unk> who are still having hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
and then , year afterward , 1995 , in kobe , japan , we had a big earthquake .
then i wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
but it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the womb .
so fetuses are even learning about the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;ll be born into .
they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself .
why would <unk> in the womb result in disease later ?
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about ptsd .
mt : this faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of <unk> experience .
the audience is led to make assumptions or <unk> that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
you may remember this as the <unk> warner merger , okay , heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a senior person at unesco and someone says , &quot; so what are you doing to eradicate world poverty ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we do an advertising campaign ?
that is actually strategy , and i &apos;m not denying that strategy has a role .
it all became music to me .
now , what this means is that if i run this piece of software , the camera sees the infrared dot , and i can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels . and now this is like a whiteboard surface .
i remember learning that people who were poor needed something material -- food , clothing , shelter -- that they didn &apos;t have .
and i even felt a sense of shame because of that .
now , when i heard him speak , it was exciting for a number of reasons .
i never once was asked for a donation , which had kind of been my mode , right .
it &apos;s about <unk> the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that <unk> their dignity , <unk> a partnership relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of donor <unk> <unk> that can happen .
that &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
right now , <unk> &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very palpable ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a vessel , it &apos;s just a tool .
what is the future of the human race ?
i now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at that .
so here are pictures of myself .
in fact , it &apos;s doubling every 18 months , and , of course , every <unk> member of the <unk> knows that that &apos;s moore &apos;s law .
but what about you ? what &apos;s it going to do to you ?
sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally <unk> people for experiments their parents wouldn &apos;t approve of .
okay , so we &apos;re interested in these sorts of things .
previous generations couldn &apos;t do this experiment at all .
and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools , <unk> million years ago .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don &apos;t leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
and second , she tells us that she walked upright , but had some adaptation for tree climbing .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing .
<unk> <unk> <unk> looks for the roots of humanity in ethiopia &apos;s badlands . here he talks about finding the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child -- and how africa holds the clues to our humanity .
and of course , if you want people to play by the rules , you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement , for as we &apos;ve discovered , you can trust , but you also need to verify .
it &apos;s considered high seas , because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims .
we need to work locally , but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide .
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay someone to do what i do . &quot;
i &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
now to be clear , i &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what i &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
now in closing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
it looks like crude oil .
so the symptoms of the complex are , no matter how complicated the problem , you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are <unk> right in your solution .
cesar and i tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works .
we clearly can .
you make lots of money .
it &apos;s far higher than the failure rate of , say , americans .
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
shut it down at once . &quot;
taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
what i &apos;m saying is our approach is simply unsustainable .
china plans to be there in just 20 years .
we &apos;re not even slowing down .
the future is inherently uncertain .
yes , things will get ugly , and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that &apos;s coming .
and this is where you come in .
and what you have to think about is , when you &apos;re dancing in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these <unk> off on our kids , but , guess what ?
everything else is mandated .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
and all we &apos;ve got is a <unk> .
they &apos;ll be able to focus their hearing , they &apos;ll be able to increase the sensitivity , decrease the sensitivity , do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
and i think this isn &apos;t 1,000 years out .
we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children . &quot;
and that &apos;s that middle set of bars .
we can &apos;t risk <unk> them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats . &quot;
it only got a 500 , it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them , and he &apos;d say , &quot; come back in a week , if you still feel lousy . &quot;
the internet , the web as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we &apos;re all talking about -- is already less than 5,000 days old .
and of course , the internet is longer than just 5,000 days ; the web is only 5,000 days .
so if we say this machine right now that we &apos;ve made is about one <unk> , one human brain , if we look at the rate that this is increasing , 30 years from now , there &apos;ll be six billion <unk> .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do spreadsheets and things at work , a word document , they aren &apos;t on the web , but they are going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
and i &apos;m saying , &quot; humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine , &quot; in a certain sense .
it &apos;s being resolved at the level of items , or ideas , or words , if you want .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and thirdly , it &apos;s going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment , and we will be in the middle of it .
and within a week i had come to believe that the second coming of christ had occurred , that it was sun <unk> moon , and that i had been specially chosen and prepared by god to be his <unk> .
these are the dead in <unk> .
and it makes anything possible , makes anything <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things .
this is a project that we just finished in <unk> for a very , very large city project that came directly out of this process , which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it .
and that turned right away into another project .
it &apos;s a wrong attitude , actually , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
what i &apos;m interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- it &apos;s a courthouse .
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .
those have to pay tuition fees know .
now having a large brain , as you know , is a big advantage , because you can actually influence your environment .
so my story is a tale of two brains , because it might surprise you , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this control of muscle is very , very important , because , you know , there can be reflexes .
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , clearly at some point , we were all of an animal nature , and at some point , we weren &apos;t . &quot;
these are men and women who , even today , can name 250 stars in the night sky .
and of course , this is what the tibetan monks told us .
the <unk> , the <unk> post to the sun , is actually an <unk> that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred <unk> of machu picchu , which is <unk> mountain , called <unk> picchu .
when they pray for the dead , they make these gestures with their hands , spinning their thoughts into the heavens .
and this is actually the place where the great mother sent the <unk> into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world .
they &apos;re unique facets of the human imagination .
this is a material you all know is styrofoam , but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff .
i fit into it , you fit into it , and a hundred years tops , my body can return to the earth with no <unk> .
it &apos;s a waste product .
you want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak <unk> <unk> , because you have multiple choices .
first you trap atoms in a special bottle .
i started a contest four years ago called dance your ph.d.
so now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me .
and she was thinking about the work i did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head-tail-tail -- they think , for deep cultural reasons , that &apos;s boring -- and they &apos;re much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head .
there are two ways of thinking about this .
when you toss a coin , you get a sequence of heads and tails .
back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty .
it &apos;ll only get it wrong one percent of the time .
so he said , &quot; i &apos;ll assume that if you have one cot death in a family , the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren &apos;t changed . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but nonetheless rather unlikely .
all of quality control , which has had a major impact on industrial processing , is <unk> by statistics .
the smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide .
an intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off , until an intelligent plug is detected . simple .
but at the same time , on the other hand , china is a sick country , the terminology coined by facebook <unk> papers -- file .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
but itself -- the <unk> -- but itself can create very powerful energy , which has never happened in the chinese history .
so because of this , the chinese really regard this microblogging as a media , not only a headline to media .
it &apos;s like a big ted , right ?
so these three years , in the past three years , social movements about microblogging really changed local government , became more and more transparent , because they can &apos;t access the data .
more and more chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their <unk> , not some imported american privilege .
so many of you know that that &apos;s beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a beautiful , wonderful life .
girl : well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying .
the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language .
that &apos;s a violin .
and it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness , which is why he has molding clay and his skull is <unk> out on the side there .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
when i look around this <unk> venue , i see a very special audience .
in many countries it is a different story .
at this decisive moment in dutch history my father was positioned near the city of <unk> .
and occurrences of civil war and <unk> have declined since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
peter van <unk> : why i chose a gun
and this program takes a shape , spits out 250 dna sequences .
this is a friction climb , up in <unk> meadows , in the yosemite high country .
you &apos;ve got to keep going .
i &apos;ve been quite interested in both .
and i &apos;m going to show you a small sample of this , but there &apos;s really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion .
but anyway , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and then working through interaction , evolution used , essentially , the <unk> species to bring on the next stage , which were the first steps in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we might as well use the third dimension .
we &apos;ve had 28 percent per year <unk> growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years .
another major revolution : the communications revolution .
if we come back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain .
but if we go to <unk> , we really have the full maturity of these trends , and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology , which are getting faster and faster , we &apos;ll have at that point .
they both empower our promise and our peril .
it &apos;s more difficult .
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing .
so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with <unk> .
and we then call that schizophrenia .
and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal .
now i said back in our little thought experiment , you &apos;re a hominid walking on the plains of africa .
and 9 / 11 has a conspiracy theory . it is a conspiracy .
and we have our own lip <unk> , and we have a leading brand .
i didn &apos;t do it as well , but we managed to get <unk> n <unk> , sting , tracy chapman , and bruce <unk> to go &apos; round the world for amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
they kept telling us , &quot; tell the truth ! &quot; as they beat us .
musician and activist peter gabriel shares his very personal motivation for standing up for human rights with the <unk> group witness -- and tells stories of citizen journalists in action .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
he knows exactly what the problem is , and he knows exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to <unk> themselves .
and if you look over here , with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on .
so here &apos;s our cunning experimenter .
so let &apos;s play a <unk> frequency and watch what happens .
this is stephen hawking &apos;s universe .
thank you .
<unk> &apos;s argument that leaving the house , <unk> on these grand adventures is joyful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t tally that neatly with my own experience .
or , &quot; that &apos;s nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s going on a cruise to antarctica next year . you know .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enterprise , or running something -- and it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s never been an <unk> or a <unk> company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very solid , steady , upward path , right from beginning to end .
odds are i probably know somebody who has made a <unk> .
no , they &apos;re not .
and then you want to give me a quick business overview .
even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
so hopefully everything has been positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my suggestions , you &apos;re going to have a very spare , very <unk> presentation , which is great for conveying who you are and getting people emotionally involved .
i didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of you is a beetle .
if you imitate something , maybe you can have an effect on it .
and then when you &apos;ve had your fill of that , you can click on one more link .
there we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
the way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
we have a serious meme running through .
but i &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest <unk> ?
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
our thinking is backwards .
through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting <unk> and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not <unk> , the things like having a <unk> .
because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform bulgaria for the better .
the industrial design magazine , i believe , is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to set <unk> because this was part of <unk> , <unk> , in the time .
after i brushed them off with a hand motion , they were very -- i finally was now accepted , and worked there for some six months .
i had a fire nine days ago .
you know -- all the stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we <unk> to a lot of magazines , did our homework , but really everywhere you look around , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and i brought him over .
rg : uh oh .
av : so taboo number three : you can &apos;t talk about your miscarriage -- but today i &apos;ll talk about mine .
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .
but you realize you <unk> yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way , which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
ultimately , i started with the experience .
all right , there &apos;s this episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star <unk> , &quot; and they &apos;re all <unk> episodes as well .
imagine hearing great , departed <unk> play again today , just as they would in person . john <unk> walker demonstrates how recordings can be analyzed for precise <unk> and pedal motions , then played back on <unk> grand <unk> .
now , since that time , we &apos;ve actually been through an extraordinary boom , the longest boom ever in the history of this country .
but now , a few months on , however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face , as someone once put it , they can &apos;t hide their uncertainty .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy who was then an 80-year-old , slightly <unk> man who lived on tomato soup and thought <unk> was very <unk> .
but interestingly too , it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the dna of restless continual innovation into society , trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work .
what i &apos;m here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i &apos;ve been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save .
and in fact , if i want to speak correctly , chinese forces me to constantly think about it .
now this is a fanciful theory .
would you mind squeezing as hard as you can , in your dominant hand , this device so i can measure your grip strength ?
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
it &apos;s not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations .
we english teachers reject them all the time .
but i am against using it as a barrier .
but they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
while this was all going on , i was in the field of weather modification , although getting a ph.d. in <unk> .
humans and <unk> and giraffes and birds and so on , are -- the red line goes up . that &apos;s the humans and livestock and pets portion .
we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future , and we produced products for the company .
let &apos;s have the next video .
this was flying around in the party last night , and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around , and you can spy on anybody you want .
and he was <unk> with the state of people &apos;s practice of the buddhist religion in india at that time .
and he comes to the town . he &apos;s a broken person .
and he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their human lives . the humans are human .
we expand . we take the feeling about remembering a mama , and we <unk> that to all beings in this meditation .
and then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are satisfied .
and , of course , they are cruel and ruthless toward others .
although , the change in your mind already does something for other beings : they can sense this new quality in yourself , and it helps them already , and gives them an example .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with a handle , is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health .
and , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
we &apos;ve heard from bill gates recently .
so it is very , very simple once you learn how to read it .
all right , let me then finish off with four general statements , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
have you started to do that ?
and out of that , you get the need for the kind of things that jimmy was talking about , which is our new kinds of organization , or a better way to put it : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
more and more , the inventors of things it will be worked out in use , in collaboration with users .
take astronomy as an example , which yochai has already mentioned .
there &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
so it &apos;s not going to be a contest between two camps , but , in between them , you &apos;ll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and people started laying bread in tribute , and eventually a team was able to do it between new zealand and spain .
so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him .
but the truth is life is being lived there .
and people called in and left messages like this .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m dressed as batman to hide my identity . &quot;
and the person who didn &apos;t , it turned out , had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job .
and over the past 35 years , i &apos;ve studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters , dopamine , things like that , all the way through circuit analysis .
some of you have this . and it &apos;s <unk> .
this was one of these cases , because she has no violence in her background , but my father did .
and now they are close as can be .
and actually , this morning , i got an email saying that we &apos;ve just finished , today , building the last piece of atlas .
and these guys , here , they &apos;re the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer -- why dna is the shape it is .
the analogy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the big bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy . the model wasn &apos;t built to do that , but it seems to do it .
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
another aha ! moment came from a 2010 wayne state university research project that looked into <unk> baseball cards of major league players .
in a related german study , researchers used fmri imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting botox to suppress smiling muscles .
&quot; because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards , &quot; he replied .
&quot; safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? &quot;
we built the bright new reception hall that made people , <unk> citizens , think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests .
president roosevelt , he said , &quot; believe you can , and you are halfway there . &quot;
on street sides all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs <unk> up offering mobile phone charging stations .
one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones in the world .
the stores nearby were out of <unk> and batteries and bread .
now , the flow of time is embedded in everything , in the erosion of a grain of sand , in the budding of a little bud into a rose .
are you reading an interview by an author ?
and even here , when i look at the great bear , i get back that feeling of being a child , hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder , and i can get back that feeling of being a child again .
we &apos;ve seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of <unk> it .
my mother was english .
at every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier .
and i was supposed to do this alone .
take anything you want out of the suitcase .
that &apos;s how i ended up in solitary , because i let my feelings be known .
thank you .
so almost all life on earth is wiped out about five times .
well <unk> <unk> has the answer .
why would that matter ?
so in theory , you could grow any organ from any one of your cells .
here &apos;s the increase in less than a decade .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
if you spin these rotors at the same speed , the robot <unk> .
and it shows you how robust the control is .
and it does that avoiding obstacles .
they sense their neighbors .
so this just shows that we can double , triple , quadruple the robot strength by just getting them to team with neighbors , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own .
i understand that . but , there are many things to know , and i want you to open your minds here , keep them open , and change your perspective about honeybees .
now this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late 1980s , when the <unk> mite came and brought many different viruses , bacteria and fungal diseases with it .
they don &apos;t experience this .
that &apos;s what the chefs go to to use for their cooking , and the honey -- they do live events -- they &apos;ll use that honey at their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they sting , so they don &apos;t want to do it either .
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
of course we also , particularly in the last decade , managed to <unk> the world in a dense chain of supermarkets , in a chain of global trade .
and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact .
in fact not many of you know that our bread , of course , was not a european invention .
and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of <unk> .
agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers among you here -- has this name of being bad , of being about pollution , about large-scale , about the destruction of the environment .
everything is linked together .
and so as i &apos;m finishing my bread here -- and i &apos;ve been baking it , and i &apos;ll try not to burn my hands .
and furthermore , if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas , it has to be <unk> using the local tools , materials and knowledge in those contexts .
that &apos;s where you can take a guy like me , an academic , but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is .
because this is what you will take away from here , a <unk> with nature , i hope .
this was just a few days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? how do we respond to this ?
this was actually just taken last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one &#91; of them &#93; . which actually shekhar kapur made an incredible movie , &quot; the <unk> queen , &quot; which i urge you to see .
but i think the final note really is that we can do it .
this guy <unk> in pit <unk> .
this is a representative patient who at the time was 73 -- totally needed to have a bypass , decided to do this instead .
i like this slide , because it &apos;s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
when you eat a big fatty meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . actually , americans are eating more fat than ever , and even more carbs . and so the percentage is lower , the actual amount is higher , and so the goal is to reduce both .
now , one of the studies funded by the atkins center found that 70 percent of the people were <unk> , 65 percent had bad breath , 54 percent had headaches – this is not a healthy way to eat .
now , on the other hand , anything that promotes intimacy is healing .
hopefully it won &apos;t <unk> .
this is based on an f. scott <unk> short story .
there were two studios involved : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence .
so we <unk> using motion capture .
it seemed to be infinite .
and here &apos;s the resulting data that comes from that , the model that comes from that .
so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film .
this is a very , very , very early test in our process .
and we found this right in this very state , in karnataka .
he has a telephone booth .
and the <unk> people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they &apos;ve lived all their lives .
there were four of us -- two bedouin drivers -- and you can just imagine , this expanse is an ocean of sand , 105 degrees , one water bottle .
i think the camel is the best designed animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them in the same way we use our <unk> vision .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
i usually won &apos;t sweat until my body reaches 105 degrees f -- enough to fry an egg .
<unk> , thank you very much for having me .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea you might take with you .
but how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next <unk> around like a vivid god , your shoulders in the clouds , or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face ?
who could sleep that night ?
but did you know that at your age judy <unk> was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture , joan of arc was leading the french army to victory and blaise pascal had cleaned up his room -- no wait , i mean he had invented the calculator ?
they ended up in a tree , and one of them holds out a hand to the other .
and human morality is more than this , but if you would remove these two pillars , there would be not much remaining i think .
another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant .
one is the understanding part of it . this is just a regular definition : the ability to understand and share the feelings of another .
now we also study more complex expressions . this is consolation .
that this is not a good test for her .
and there &apos;s a very simple task that they need to do .
and so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lone nut , it &apos;s not two nuts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
i &apos;ve spent the last decade <unk> myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
and this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy living nearly killed me
and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude .
really cool stuff .
now these studies are scientifically valid , and they &apos;ve been replicated , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
a priest ?
there &apos;s a last group of people who believe that the indus people were the ancestors of people living in south india today .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze .
this sign is the most <unk> sign in the indus script , and it &apos;s only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair .
and it turns out that in india there &apos;s a long tradition of names being based on <unk> and star constellations present at the time of birth .
space , we all know what it looks like .
the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a household name .
jansky had made a historic discovery , that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves .
all the young people , actually , from the city .
you know , someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that &apos;s ok because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion , it &apos;s because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence .
look at that beautiful thing <unk> showed us . she scared us with the lava man .
a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance .
but what more could she have done if she &apos;d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
in the rwanda children &apos;s museum , there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the children &apos;s museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died .
and so here &apos;s the challenge : i want you to help me create a fully 3d , dynamic , <unk> contact model .
they can <unk> on <unk> that vary as you saw -- in the probability of contact , the movement of that surface and the type of <unk> that are present .
this one <unk> itself as floating algae .
boy : spiny .
let &apos;s slow it down and you can see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford university , one of my collaborators , is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called shape deposition manufacturing , where he can <unk> claws right into an artificial foot .
they &apos;re -- almost look alien . and the secret , which they stick on with , involves their hairy toes .
here you are , pulling off the band-aid .
these tuned structures allow the spines , friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging , difficult surfaces .
so the large <unk> whales will produce long , beautiful songs , which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females , both to find one another and to select a mate .
so when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters , less than half the time they need to use whistles .
when we think of <unk> areas for animals like dolphins , this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign .
and after the berlin wall fell , the navy made these systems available to whale <unk> to see what they could hear .
you only hear the low frequencies .
now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they &apos;re dispersed , imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations .
and they &apos;ve already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design , you can reduce that noise by 90 percent .
they could slow down by about 50 percent .
we see alien worlds , we see alien solar systems -- 300 now , and still counting -- and they &apos;re not like us .
the whole resources are there available for you .
and we &apos;re seeing a steady increase among males .
and there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
now , when you have initiatives like the $ 100 laptop , i kind of <unk> at the idea that we &apos;re going to introduce a whole new generation of people to computing with this standard <unk> interface .
thank you .
i think none of these is the problem .
daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances .
usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
and they &apos;re out there !
but we are many more .
part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is <unk> -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet , and controlling the balls with my feet .
and then you get crazy .
ok , so since you all don &apos;t understand what the <unk> pattern is , i &apos;m going to give you a little clue .
now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you &apos;ve got somebody up here who is the <unk> principle of doing that for his whole life . ok ?
and then it comes to rest . just a little thing about time .
working with space and the lines in space in a different way .
and then changing levels .
this year -- maybe you could show the slides -- this year we &apos;re carrying this <unk> , which we had a lot to do with and helped handspring design it .
we can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that , and get more information about the clothing that you &apos;re interested in as you &apos;re trying it on .
( scott adams : i realized that at some point i might be the world &apos;s expert on what &apos;s wrong with <unk> .
and we &apos;re announcing a new product here tonight , which is the first time this has ever been shown in public .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can &apos;t grow them in the <unk> .
electrons disappear in a kind of <unk> , and there is only energy . and you can &apos;t see energy .
that &apos;s what he thought he was there for .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . do you know that ?
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well what &apos;s the point of these , <unk> ?
and we <unk> about this for about four years .
now when google <unk> a book , they put it into a really nice format .
let me give you an example .
suddenly , in the <unk> , there started to be a buzz .
but guess what , nobody will really care .
but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda .
if you <unk> your toe , that &apos;s a one a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if i left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes , you would literally cease to hear it .
many people take refuge in headphones , but they turn big , public spaces like this , shared soundscapes , into millions of tiny , little personal sound bubbles .
you can do it in a beautiful place as well , like in a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i &apos;d be , like , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you for staying here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and they walk off .
because they weren &apos;t with us on the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd , an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the <unk> has collapsed ... what else ?
actually , that photo was pasted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher receives them , they paste them on the school .
and today &apos;s talk is about brains and , yay , somewhere i have a brain fan out there .
and this is something we can work on my lifetime . i felt i could make a difference , and so i tried to get out of the computer business , into the brain business .
but sometimes , a science has some other attributes which makes it really , really interesting .
what good is more going to do ?
there &apos;s something we believe that just , it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
what it is is intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t consider the alligator very intelligent , not like in a human sort of way .
in humans , we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex . and nature did a little trick .
it &apos;s not like you just look over there and say , what am i seeing now ?
not like computer memory . it &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
those are the things that are going to happen first .
we need a little bit of police ; we need a little bit of military , but for defense .
your robe gives it away . &quot;
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and then , when she closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash like this : by hand .
this group uses three , one each .
it &apos;s real .
she managed to study english and learn that as a foreign language .
well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects .
if you think so , then you are not like the u.s. employers who are , in fact , part of our experiment , meaning we did exactly that .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions .
the price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and safety and health ; we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
and so they hire personal <unk> ; they &apos;re popping <unk> like breath <unk> .
i &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to enter into other people &apos;s minds and learn what they have to offer .
they have <unk> <unk> .
that is what the unconscious mind <unk> for .
we found her in a railway track , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know many .
where does their journey begin ?
and it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
what has been my challenge ?
they need your empathy .
lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
well , first of all , i blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries must be different .
the bad words -- see , when people think about a place and they don &apos;t find a place on the map , they think , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts , how can you say that <unk> are better than hammers ?
the oed has 33 different <unk> definitions for set .
and there &apos;s this guy , mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in the u.k.
so , this whole time i &apos;ve been saying , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m just going to grab a chair here .
and to cut a long story short , here &apos;s where i came to .
and so , gradually over these three days , you start off kind of trying to figure out , &quot; why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff ? &quot;
they may well be by a ted speaker , and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual , emotional journey .
manufacturers haven &apos;t built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips because they &apos;re not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand .
&quot; they &apos;re not sure this rises to the level of <unk> , and they &apos;re not set up technically to find the device . &quot;
instead of <unk> the gps signals , you fake them .
and &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> and <unk> , and we live and work in india .
this is a video prototype .
so this work is a <unk> of an upside-down man .
the debate is over the proposition : &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear energy . &quot; true or false ?
and so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas , <unk> , which in most places is <unk> -- and nuclear .
we have been taking down the russian warheads , turning it into electricity .
<unk> emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to co2 .
now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation , because we know for example , india and pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities .
for wind , there &apos;s a larger area , but much smaller footprint .
the reality is that there &apos;s , what , 21 nations that have nuclear power ?
and in the united states senate , we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables alone .
i used to worry about the 10,000 year factor .
thank you for that .
this was -- my motivation was actually during apollo .
for the first time ever , we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration .
<unk> teams from seven countries entered the competition , spending between one to 25 million dollars each .
orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .
and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term .
would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ?
so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves , they can become <unk> small .
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column .
<unk> to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the column , which was quite a surprising discovery .
inspired by cell division , michael <unk> writes algorithms that design <unk> fascinating shapes and forms with millions of facets . no person could draft them by hand , but they &apos;re <unk> -- and they could revolutionize the way we think of architectural form .
so look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes dancing around for you .
this one is a disorder which is quite rare .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see this chip even breathes .
it &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
and i think a lot of people in this room , i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself .
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural identities .
we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories , share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices .
at the same time , we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world .
so i was , more or less , <unk> as &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought &quot; perhaps , if i made these ants some apartments , they &apos;ll move in . &quot;
now that is called the <unk> <unk> .
so i &apos;m thinking &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , rough estimate , sometimes five , six to seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i bent it &apos; round , and made it into the chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s very painstaking work , but the best things come in small packages .
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they &apos;ve done that , then they can do extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , the absolute concentration of consciousness , awareness , an absolute <unk> of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity .
my <unk> body flew in one direction , my <unk> bike flew in the other .
i kept imagining all the walks i might not take with them , the art projects i might not mess up , the <unk> i might not <unk> at , the aisles i might not walk down .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> session at that point .
so if you approach them from behind , down wind , you can push them over and they go <unk> in the mud . &quot;
twenty years ago , doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 percent survival rate .
as i became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life , i was probably 30 pounds less than i am right now .
and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black .
walking upright , we are told , is the threshold of what made us human .
he &apos;s the president of the international society of limb <unk> , which is the least <unk> term i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three and a half months premature , and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive .
so as soon as i tried to get near the piano , i was firmly shoved off .
and in the end , you got so quick , that things like &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; were no problem , were they ?
would you like to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag . &quot;
i don &apos;t get it .
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t contaminated , a world that isn &apos;t polluted .
so that we know today , they &apos;re capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when i began .
the long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years .
and it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now <unk> .
somebody said that yesterday .
we &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in florida are different from the problems in new york .
are you going to come and drag me off ?
is it out there with the politicians ?
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same , but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity , but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .
it &apos;s actually quite lifeless . once it forms , it doesn &apos;t really do anything .
so now that you &apos;re all experts on protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game with these protocells .
so we &apos;re able to then see the self-assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we &apos;ve seen previously , and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse , very complex , organic black tar .
in his lab , martin <unk> makes &quot; protocells , &quot; experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work demonstrates how life might have first occurred on earth ... and perhaps elsewhere too .
this is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening .
what &apos;s the -- how did you know that ? they did .
but if we did this in every single -- every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency .
carbon black is that <unk> that otherwise <unk> in your pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s associated with .
the birds were able to jump from one to the other .
you can subscribe to updates from him . you can talk to him .
but maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet .
we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium .
already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
the fact is , when we do our market research around the world , we see that there &apos;s nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile .
so let me talk about hydrogen first .
that &apos;s a huge <unk> capability , a mobile <unk> capability .
if we can see this possible future , others can too .
you had to survive .
and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding , for support .
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live ?
it became a book . it became a show .
and <unk> came up with an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here , on the west coast , you &apos;ve destroyed your forest .
but you can see in this picture , we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in brazil .
and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies , i studied this emerging field of landscape ecology .
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was , right at the end of the american revolution .
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .
or the <unk> turtle , needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places .
maybe a timber <unk> lived there .
there is such power in bringing science and visualization together , that we can create images like this , perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass .
and we , at the moment , in our society , have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this .
i don &apos;t need to go into that .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
this is a <unk> building .
one place we &apos;re all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question , in a very artistic and indirect kind of way .
but it &apos;s happening all over the place , and these tools are part of what &apos;s making it possible .
seriously -- give that one a hand , it &apos;s pretty great .
alex <unk> : the route to a sustainable future
and you &apos;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but congress seems not to have let that bother them too much .
if you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them , that &apos;s not okay .
some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made out of what we &apos;ve found , and all of it <unk> those industries .
that &apos;s the easy thing .
i went to a very elitist , <unk> , expensive education in india , and that almost destroyed me .
and i thought i &apos;d start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
so when i said that , they said , &quot; well show us what is possible . what are you doing ?
all the power comes from the sun .
democracy , citizenship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if your animal is sick .
if there &apos;s tension in the village , if attendance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a friction between the teacher and the parent , the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; shake hands .
you use sign language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
success story .
and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration .
you see the electron flow with the <unk> we as artists have generated for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
&quot; i am so much better off physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have one minute &apos;s regret .
he wouldn &apos;t lend him the money , and of course six months later ray croc had exactly the same idea .
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are monet prints .
we gathered up our materials and we went out of the room , and counted to a half hour .
and i &apos;m going to show you why .
and they blow two of them up , and they have two gorgeous <unk> <unk> of meaningful things to them , and we say , &quot; which one would you like to give up ? &quot;
we bring in a whole new group of naive harvard students and we say , &quot; you know , we &apos;re doing a photography course , and we can do it one of two ways .
night shots are beautiful , piercing the big <unk> and the milky way .
voices : it &apos;s going ballistic . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
remember , this tradition comes to us not from the <unk> of <unk> , back in time , but further still , before we were scratching out these stories on <unk> , or we were doing the <unk> on walls in moist , <unk> caves .
that kind of food , yeah .
the kind with the corrugated roof , you know .
and so we left my father fast asleep , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i let her go by herself , and we get in the car .
&quot; would this guy have , like , a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face ? &quot;
do i want to walk in , because unless i have <unk> &apos;s thread to anchor -- enough metaphors for you ? -- somewhere , i may not get out .
see , we &apos;re a secret club with a secret handshake .
she says , &quot; ma , you got to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m with the little lady . damn ! &quot;
she jumped out of that car . &quot;
i &apos;m really scared .
so , what is the social result of this ?
where can i go today and who can i do it with ?
and if we have it , you &apos;ll decide how many miles to drive , what mode of travel , where to live and work .
you can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it &apos;s coming , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
so , i &apos;d like us to launch the wireless internet interstate wireless mesh system , and require that this network be accessible to everyone , with open standards .
and they got here in the late 1960s .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a closing thought .
because you all used to be three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just such an authentic person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is all about .
i was eating <unk> with pie .
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j so many , in fact , that seeing has become a bit of a problem .
and i thought it was astonishing to speculate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound .
it was predominantly a white , rich , corporate group that was not representative of the city .
it looks like a fairly simple thing , but this was a half a million dollar project ?
and i think people were amazed at two things -- i think they were amazed at the destruction , but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the <unk> of new yorkers that i found very moving .
because when we looked at the four platforms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be <unk> to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
so yeah , i think there is a chance to <unk> at how we think about cities .
dr : it was an honor to do .
and i know that kids get <unk> every year .
if , god forbid , any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion , most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks .
you have to be familiar with the issues we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , it occurred to tom that a $ 20 helmet is a good way to protect a $ 100,000 graduate education .
this is not accurate , but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was labeled the following things .
in other words , they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order .
he was told that a cure did not exist .
today , all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years .
it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use .
orlando , same kind of stadium , open-air stadium . people have been sitting in the strong sun , in the very high humidity in the afternoon , and they did not enjoy . it was not comfortable .
they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find .
basically , what he does is , he has all these services for <unk> and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for , but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world .
so we said , &quot; what are the steps required to empower the teacher ? &quot;
let &apos;s see what happens here .
and the daughter &apos;s husband , he also was sick from his wife &apos;s exhaustion .
but the visual complexity is still very high .
now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
now , when we have emotions , we show them .
and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get <unk> , which is soft and dark .
now to put this in perspective , let me just zoom out for a minute .
after all , aging is not a piece of cake .
and all things being equal , older people direct their cognitive resources , like attention and memory , to positive information more than negative .
we savor life .
those guys made me want to , like , &quot; i &apos;m going to do that <unk> at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s kind of like , honestly a lot of times i don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on when i &apos;m dancing .
they &apos;ve called me &quot; brother &quot; and &quot; uncle &quot; and invited me again and again over five years .
<unk> : the second fort laramie treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the <unk> &apos; ownership of the sacred black hills .
the fort laramie treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land .
they were tired of treaties .
teacher turnover is eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
so where does that leave us ?
flash forward : 1960 , 24 percent child mortality has dropped to <unk> percent today .
you get it , either in pill form or you get it as an injection ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
when we &apos;re dealing with people like this ?
but it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level .
it &apos;s called &quot; are you smarter than a fifth grader ? &quot;
bmw is a pretty safe car .
the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe .
now , you may think to yourself , &quot; well , if my eyes depended on it , you know , i would obviously use it every day . &quot;
we need to combine this with the scientific method .
that &apos;s just a caveat . that &apos;s different from actually having an effective ad campaign .
and this is nothing new .
it &apos;ll dim .
we do them for our clients .
we let that lie around in the sun .
now -- -- logic , logically , you have got to this position from this , without moving the wrist .
now i will interact . so a different person all the time , so not the same person can answer .
now , if you are interested , i will demonstrate some underground techniques .
so here , to follow my cards , i must look at the shuffle from the begin -- ah , we are started together . it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
which card shall i use ? queen or five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
wait , wait , wait -- please take any card .
another suit . lg : diamonds , perfect .
empathy .
ace of diamonds , yes ? zoe : yeah .
so here , all the cards are face down -- you agree ?
and then , king , after exactly five seconds .
i see some of you recognize this child .
i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one-buttock company . &quot;
if you were tone-deaf , you couldn &apos;t change the gears on your car , in a stick shift car .
so let &apos;s see what &apos;s really going on here .
i always tell my students , &quot; if you have a deceptive cadence , be sure to raise your eyebrows . then everybody will know . &quot;
bring that person into your mind , and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e , and you &apos;ll hear everything that chopin had to say .
now , i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years old , i &apos;d been conducting for 20 years , and i suddenly had a realization .
she went to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , and her brother was eight , and the parents were lost .
so , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , take a look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of everyone we &apos;re testing here today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for 21st century tasks , that mechanistic , <unk> approach doesn &apos;t work , often doesn &apos;t work , and often does harm .
think about your own work .
standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is because it &apos;s very light .
and then in a series of 55 balls , it reduces , <unk> -- each ball and the spaces between them reduce <unk> , until they get down to this little earth .
and the blue side , the compliment , faces the other way .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
but it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky .
was <unk> dollars , and for a hunger charity , <unk> dollars .
so nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave , daring , <unk> new fundraising endeavors for fear that if the thing fails , their reputations will be dragged through the mud .
what were they to do about this ?
the overhead went up .
dan <unk> : the way we think about charity is dead wrong
then you have the clapping audience , yeah , actually taking part in doing the music .
people who made those <unk> , <unk> , all those beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible . &quot;
it &apos;s only the execution of the written music , no interpretation . &quot;
now that &apos;s great . what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , when it &apos;s needed , the authority is there . it &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is about process .
as a culture , we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future , and where we might move forward from this point .
there are 98 <unk> nations in the world .
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
and it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
they are <unk> whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
and the head of the council said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition <unk> , we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but we have a problem .
there &apos;s no real , true balancing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don &apos;t see things that are actually pretty <unk> challenges .
in fact , there &apos;s about five states that are worse and only really four states that don &apos;t face this big challenge .
or even if you &apos;re flat , you might shift money into it .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had an <unk> motive of visiting <unk> <unk> , and it was this : that i was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
if you &apos;re laughing , you know what i mean .
many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady i knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
now , i realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
we are all born artists .
when you have a conversation like this , the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started .
but parents tell them , &quot; it will all be washed away by the waves . &quot;
but kids , usually they do art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
but such a teacher is seldom found .
in <unk> bars , there are always people who sing &quot; she &apos;s gone &quot; or &quot; hotel california , &quot; <unk> the guitar <unk> .
right this minute , we can turn off tv , log off the internet , get up and start to do something .
the students go into a kind of trance .
he said it was his profile . &quot; then what are you ? &quot; i asked . &quot; an actor , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with how i got to this point .
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
if so , more warming is in the pipeline .
but that lag is exactly what is expected .
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
it &apos;s critical now that when a car crash happens it isn &apos;t just the stunt person we make safe , it &apos;s the crew .
well , we used to use <unk> . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .
but now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon .
that &apos;s all it is , a <unk> castle .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> of the united states air force did the most spectacular thing .
now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ? -- when you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen .
and they &apos;ve made a dummy of him . that &apos;s exactly what it looked like .
we expect , and others expect , that perhaps the faa , the <unk> might say , &quot; you need to put someone in a suit that &apos;s not inflated , that &apos;s connected to the aircraft . &quot;
there have been three themes , haven &apos;t there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what i want to talk about .
and the girl said , &quot; they will in a minute . &quot;
the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . i believe this passionately , that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , we grow out of it . or rather , we get educated out if it .
everywhere on earth .
the whole system was invented -- around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century .
the brain isn &apos;t divided into <unk> .
they did ballet ; they did tap ; they did jazz ; they did modern ; they did contemporary .
it &apos;s still going strong , with positive press to die for .
let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
dubai , to me , is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen .
i &apos;d like to end , before going back to the middle east , with a quote from one of the greatest <unk> to put <unk> to parchment .
it &apos;s also <unk> .
fair enough . they are disorders of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t actually even know what the tools will be , nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different .
how are you going to replicate ? &quot;
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
the children have taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that it &apos;s the content that is more important .
i have been changed with my children .
howard does the experiment , and he gets the data back , and he plots it on a curve , and all of a sudden he realizes it &apos;s not a nice bell curve .
this was his <unk> . he was obsessed with it !
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
it &apos;s what people always say when you ask them what they want in a coffee .
a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .
that &apos;s what it was . and why were we attached to that ?
he got traded a couple of times , he ended up in the <unk> for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a &apos;s .
we all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for <unk> symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized , because a study came out , a big one , <unk> .
thank you .
but dad got really scared : he didn &apos;t want us doing that .
but there &apos;s a middle ground , too .
these are four very different ways of looking at the world . i even gave them names .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you hit print -- and this is from <unk> , by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves : <unk> panel arrangements , simple line drawings without tone and a <unk> reading sequence .
and that &apos;s what i proposed : that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas : along the x axis and the y axis and <unk> .
it &apos;s by a guy named daniel <unk> <unk> in britain .
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light .
now that &apos;s honesty and integrity , and it &apos;s also why fey &apos;s performances left such a lasting impression .
if you have a baby and you think that baby &apos;s gay , you should be allowed to put it up for adoption .
and perry &apos;s policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain .
this song is called &quot; farther than the sun . &quot;
i &apos;d like to start tonight by something completely different , asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment .
they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared , 65 million years ago , at a time when whales still had legs , and they come from a <unk> little <unk> fish <unk> -- <unk> me a little <unk> storytelling here .
and how do you do that ?
the california sea lion takes the molas as soon as they come into the bay , <unk> off their fins , fashions them into the ultimate <unk> , mola style , and then tosses them back and forth .
i &apos;m going to show you our latest dataset .
and what i found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans .
so as you can see here , this is a , <unk> diameter circuit board .
you just don &apos;t hear that every day .
<unk> .
if you &apos;re in australia , it &apos;s mostly <unk> who are in jail .
she told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call <unk> dance .
because nobody can get a <unk> .
so , why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis ?
goodbye , mahatma gandhi .
can i have my last audio track please ?
no way , that &apos;s impossible ! no no no no no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could do the whole thing with addition .
von neumann , and a <unk> , and a mathematician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
the input and the output was by <unk> tape at first .
&quot; aha ! &quot; so , they figured out it &apos;s a code problem .
i know when i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
he would run that thing all night long , running these things , if anybody remembers stephen wolfram , who reinvented this stuff .
so there it is , 50 years later , sitting there -- sort of suspended animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes when i do our chat , four americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat .
this is a global problem .
beautiful town .
and he &apos;s fed up with it . he &apos;s fed up with <unk> his friends , his family , his community .
they want to be self -- they want to <unk> themselves .
you know , it &apos;s been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long , long time .
we &apos;re not teaching our kids .
and most kids do .
so , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
around america , if we just look back now , there is plenty of wonderful things going on .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011 .
the web links everything , and very soon it will mediate most human activity .
but interestingly , anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain .
and he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on <unk> in new york , taking out $ 10,000 from an atm here , $ 30,000 from an atm there , using cloned credit cards .
born in southern germany to a stable and <unk> middle class family , his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking .
and most of them , with the exception of script and <unk> , they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world -- only on the web .
i think there are any number of reasons , and i &apos;m just going to not get into detail but mention a few .
but that they &apos;re really all market driven , and what &apos;s driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts .
we also found a lot of examples of dead <unk> stores that have been converted into all sorts of <unk> uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one .
eventually , i expect that the streets will probably extend through a <unk> of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful , and it &apos;s helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in <unk> have now , or have announced plans to be , <unk> .
the creek had been <unk> under the parking lot .
their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia , but they &apos;re less diverse than cities .
&quot; looking at your vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a full day &apos;s work . &quot;
but it really didn &apos;t begin there ; it began with a conversation with a woman .
that &apos;s essentially a gender ; that &apos;s essentially a resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a body world , and the species really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real significance in us <unk> our bodies to our heads -- that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent .
and i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because it &apos;s very <unk> to happiness and agnes .
maybe it &apos;s because my native state of south carolina , which is not much smaller than present-day hungary , once imagined a future for itself as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too trusting , because he stayed where he was long after the nazi <unk> in austria and even after the <unk> and <unk> began in budapest .
he got the same answer : &quot; you bring the best workers that you can find , and if they are good enough , i will hire them . &quot;
and just as clearly , it is saying , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie all by myself . &quot;
as i said , he swore too much .
and you can just imagine them .
they know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take the severe ones , and we <unk> the other ones the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; soviet union .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
and what i &apos;m going to try -- i hope i make the following points .
and as i will point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states of america lies beneath the sea .
it &apos;s absolutely pitch black , because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean , which is 12,000 feet . in the rift valley , it &apos;s 9,000 feet .
and so we went along this mountain range , in an area along galapagos rift , and did we find the missing heat .
so , i began designing a new technology of telepresence , using robotic systems to replicate myself , so i wouldn &apos;t have to cycle my vehicle system .
finding the state of preservation .
and i was looking at it yesterday , it &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , education is just not readily accessible .
so , having seen the impact of this , andrew and i decided that we needed to really try and scale this up , to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could .
so what made these courses so different ?
every few minutes , the video pauses and the students get asked a question .
so we tried to convince , for example , some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy .
and in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
and even personalization whether it &apos;s via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we &apos;ve shown you .
i was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what infinity might mean , when i was a child .
and of course we live in a society that &apos;s all about <unk> other peoples &apos; reality .
i have questions with the values of newtonian science , like rationality . you &apos;re supposed to be rational in an argument .
so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker that alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve , claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor .
i think you can make fun of the have but not the <unk> , which is why you don &apos;t see me making fun of kenneth lay and his charming wife .
i really miss the old <unk> now , i &apos;ll tell you that .
and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do <unk> properly .
huh ? huh ? what ? can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
and i suspect , by someone who actively <unk> us .
i was thinking about what moshe safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book , hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty .
president george w. bush : whatever it costs to defend our security , and whatever it costs to defend our freedom , we must pay it .
ten years ago , you couldn &apos;t have found an astronomer -- well , very few astronomers -- in the world who would &apos;ve told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are in real , real danger .
one of the things he <unk> about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go <unk> and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
obviously , we don &apos;t want one of those .
so , what can we do about it ?
and this is my <unk> .
we spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don &apos;t die in airplane accidents , and we &apos;re not spending hardly anything on this . and yet , this is completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught <unk> again .
i hope it will be .
this is very , very important because this is the system , this is the <unk> , out of which life on the planet came , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an astonishing insight , and we have only found out about this recently .
and this is what the system involves , a number of sites in the southern hemisphere , shown in those circles .
so anyone coming along later simply <unk> the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
when earthquakes take place , massive amounts of these new microbes we &apos;ve never seen before come out of the sea floor .
<unk> john <unk> is leading the team that is building an underwater network of <unk> cameras and sensors that will turn our ocean into a global interactive lab -- sparking an explosion of rich data about the world below .
and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
inexplicable versus understood . you know , too often we want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know , it &apos;s true , the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i rather play something completely unheard of , and even with flaws , than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its <unk> .
risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying , as they should be , for a pioneering city .
there are emotions of the victims .
daniel libeskind builds on very big ideas . here , he shares 17 words that <unk> his vision for architecture -- raw , risky , emotional , radical -- and that offer inspiration for any bold creative pursuit .
and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size .
do you see that coming , really , truly , or just on a few key routes ?
em : it must , actually . if it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trouble .
with that capital , solarcity purchases and <unk> the panel on the roof and then charges the <unk> or business owner a monthly lease payment , which is less than the utility bill .
we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
it &apos;s much like on a jet .
how on earth has one person been able to innovate in this way ?
look at that .
boy , if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it .
we were hungry .
here is our tradition : at every himba village , there is a sacred fire .
and so far , with the support of world wildlife fund , we &apos;ve been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .
very important as well -- we invest this money in aids and hiv education .
wallet guides -- standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world -- are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution .
shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the common species .
it &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
science tends to look at the world through the rational , the quantitative -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a terrific context of understanding .
well , within about three weeks , i <unk> turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras into 25 time-lapse cameras .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
this is something no <unk> photographer would ever do -- you put some cheesy illustration on your shot , right ? -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to <unk> these points .
and here , if you watch , you can see the <unk> retreating .
this is what a couple of the cameras saw .
could india become a source , or a global hub , of innovation , just like it &apos;s become a global hub for back office services and software development ?
when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on , they said , &quot; we are working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor without having been a student .
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , births , strokes , heart disease , hip replacements , 4 a.m. emergencies .
it works a little something like -- this is a recent google search for four in the morning .
i said , i know a coded message when i see one .
everybody in our society &apos;s life is touched by cancer -- if not personally , then through a loved one , a family member , colleague , friend .
and in that space station we have the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor treating fields to over 20 different cancers in the lab , and we see this effect in all of them .
he received the standard treatments .
but what we can see is , by month six , the tumor has responded and it &apos;s begun to melt away .
it &apos;s only the beginning .
this is a new work , it &apos;s a new program .
in fact they go 15 feet deep , and collect rain water from roof , there is a small pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
somewhere a stream or a <unk> is running through here .
this is called <unk> . we have , in english , surface water and ground water .
and you have to go further down .
these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides .
and hiv infection rates are down 27 percent : 600,000 less people a year are getting hiv in sub-saharan africa .
ten percent &apos;s come from india .
they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth .
and the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita gdp , basically every country with a per capita gdp of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
actually , for the first 20 years , the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t really grow .
buy african products .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping ipods not bombs -- i mean , it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman &apos;s new book .
so 500 people applied , and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question , and thus inspect it and then blog about it .
so having people involved in planning for 2020 is not necessarily going to change anything , because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : how the net aids dictatorships
like a man .
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
because for me growing up at that time , and our relationship with this man box , &quot; do you want some ? &quot; meant one of two things : sex or drugs -- and we weren &apos;t doing drugs .
folks , i &apos;m <unk> .
as an indian , and now as a politician and a government minister , i &apos;ve become rather concerned about the hype we &apos;re hearing about our own country , all this talk about india becoming a world leader , even the next superpower .
in other words , all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries , whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories .
but , lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days , so , it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through .
she can &apos;t understand the dialogue .
this can sometimes have unintended consequences . ok .
and those of you who <unk> your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the <unk> note , spelling out the <unk> .
so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water
and i feel now like george bush .
now that title , that phrase , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that i just love , and would like to read for you .
and it &apos;s a good thing that there isn &apos;t , because if there were , then mother nature would have a problem : how on earth do you get chimps to mate ?
this is the hard one , the one that isn &apos;t obvious . that &apos;s why i leave it to the end .
ok ? stop . all right , now .
don &apos;t know the reason for the pink <unk> , but anyway , they &apos;re there in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons &#91; for &#93; why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly .
so it should look like this . you should be looking at something like this .
so now , bob mckim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s .
and we &apos;ve certainly learnt that over time , you get much better brainstorming , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules .
and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .
they can be a little skeptical ; i &apos;ll come back to that .
and you know what it feels like : all of that uncertainty while you &apos;re left out in the hallway while the <unk> are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms , wondering what the heck &apos;s going on .
as a result , we &apos;d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time -- but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together .
so we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . we figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful .
i was faster but just as depressed .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
and the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; <unk> , &quot; hopefully for the last time in public ever .
he made sure that everything lined up .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
and the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .
it is questions .
as you see in today &apos;s modern liberal democracies , the society , the state , not only allows us to determine our self , to shape our self , it also demands it of us .
it means living up to your own full potential as a human being .
so these are the kinds of layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to lead you through today -- the question of , what are the intentions that you bring to bear when you &apos;re designing something ?
so my <unk> , sebastian <unk> , and i thought , there must be a better way .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll do one in the fall .
he <unk> it in place , tugs it with his nose , and smash .
and we were in for our first surprise .
there needs to be some kind of <unk> mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe , and the speed that we observe , and the output of the system .
a load cell measures forces , and this is actually a <unk> load cell that has a little crystal in it .
there &apos;s that <unk> appendage -- there &apos;s the heel , and it &apos;s going to swing around and hit the load cell .
very , very convenient solution to that particular problem .
and <unk> : &quot; it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean . &quot;
this , i think , represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built .
i don &apos;t know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
now , look at that ; look , it &apos;s -- she just blew me away .
so the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one .
similarly , the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field , devoid of context , is really not the -- excuse me , it &apos;s fairly <unk> -- is really not the approach that we need to take .
basically , new york was built on the backs of <unk> , and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .
you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially <unk> them .
so , you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this <unk> .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
and this happens every two weeks .
i took her portrait up on top of the <unk> temple .
and this area of the <unk> amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972 .
in fact , on that other side is the area , <unk> <unk> , the area where osama bin laden &apos;s supposed to be . this is the tribal area .
that was one of the big motivating factors .
so that &apos;s sort of the part , and let me move on then and show you the hubble <unk> deep field .
but you get out to jupiter and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . it &apos;s a problem .
and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies , right ?
so the stuff that &apos;s in this picture that &apos;s white , that is the dark matter .
and so you know when you first saw this picture , it didn &apos;t mean quite so much to you .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
but what we &apos;re hoping when we get to <unk> , we &apos;ll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth .
the result , of course , is that we get stressed .
forty-seven percent .
you know , this is crazy . we do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
and this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues , i had trouble holding anything .
i wondered , could you become more creative , then , by looking for limitations ?
it did not happen overnight .
you have to have <unk> at all times , clicking away , you have to have a government <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring .
stalin &apos;s enforced famines of the 1930s , the <unk> , killed millions of <unk> , and they faced the nazis in the &apos; 40s , who came through <unk> , burning , raping , and in fact many of these women were shipped to germany as forced labor .
they are dying of sadness . &quot;
and , as a psychologist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
we &apos;re getting used to a new way of being alone together .
human relationships are rich and they &apos;re messy and they &apos;re demanding .
it <unk> her .
because the moment that people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become anxious , they panic , they <unk> , they reach for a device .
but we &apos;re at risk , because actually it &apos;s the opposite that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but it seemed that we didn &apos;t win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted and quite frequently i -- -- quite frequently i really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner .
maybe it &apos;s because dad used to read to us at night .
so i let them -- just they had to be neat and clean .
i came up with a pyramid eventually , that i don &apos;t have the time to go on that .
yet losing , not afraid to fall , if <unk> we have given all . for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span .
i can never answer that , as far as the individuals are concerned .
have i <unk> enough ?
the second challenge was cells .
now today , many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
and we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology .
we then are able to actually image those , do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing <unk> form .
i was missing school . it was pretty much miserable .
i was a little kid , and i was like , &quot; yeah . i &apos;ll have that . i &apos;ll have that surgery . &quot;
now you may have noticed there &apos;s a new sector emerging called <unk> .
and linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous wikipedia , and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve .
three , pressing unresolved environmental concerns .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd ; i want the music it plays .
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
we have to flee our women and children , we have to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
and i drove home late that night with batteries and ice .
together : someone get me <unk> !
co : i decided to stay in the country , give up the master &apos;s in moscow and to work full-time to make this happen .
now that expense can be huge , but if the town can mobilize x amount of volunteers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town &apos;s contribution .
they have <unk> and spreadsheets and data .
so , that &apos;ll be -- in the 18 minutes that i &apos;m given to talk here , between two and three thousand people will have <unk> to the cities .
and it was set in a wider <unk> ooze .
the buildings here are <unk> .
those green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and when you &apos;re a legal <unk> , you suddenly have politics .
little did i know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true .
but think of it . these men , who hadn &apos;t had the educational opportunities i &apos;d had , helped me gain <unk> qualifications in law by their dedicated help .
optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font , but by using <unk> device <unk> scanners and speech synthesizers , he developed a machine that could read any font .
but , you know , i find reading with machines a very lonely process .
well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different english-speaking countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter .
the average lifespan &apos;s more than doubled since <unk> , and it &apos;s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day .
and one final thing . wish people like me luck , okay ?
the second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that , once the androids start doing jobs , we don &apos;t have to do them anymore , and we get freed up from drudgery and toil .
the societal challenges that come along with that kind of inequality deserve some attention .
the economic playbook is surprisingly clear , surprisingly straightforward , in the short term especially .
and my biggest worry is that we &apos;re creating a world where we &apos;re going to have <unk> technologies embedded in kind of a <unk> society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity .
i have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of god over the years .
some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
in the second verse comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the great <unk> or the tribal protector ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by seeking the god within . by cultivating my own <unk> .
and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .
there are no neanderthal fossils that are older than 40 years old that we &apos;ve ever found , and the average age of most of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have adapted to these new diets .
so , those energy , matter einstein show were equivalent , and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all <unk> , so it &apos;s one long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it .
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go , and our choice , so to speak , in technology , is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .
and they would say , &quot; well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
we took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , <unk> beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; you know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
and so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for the adults working at <unk> &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom .
the teachers that we work with -- and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do .
i think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
and then right beyond -- there &apos;s usually a little chain there -- right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
so then , the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
he &apos;s evangelical about it . he brings his cousins in now .
you email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
i was that girl .
eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children . oh .
there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
you know , there &apos;s also something called the &quot; complete idiot &apos;s guide ? &quot;
and cape cod , there are idyllic roads , and all of us can drive in this room .
that &apos;s my baby <unk> . thank you .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and i &apos;ve always felt bad about it , in a sense .
so , this is sort of a complication i &apos;ve found .
i discovered that cheetos are good , expressive material .
you know the <unk> is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging .
from everything from a weird hotel lobby , to <unk> wrap placed over your window , to this moment where i had my road in front of my house paved dark black , and this white <unk> was sitting there dying in the sun .
and i was reminded by karen armstrong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn &apos;t look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the united states , minus an area roughly equal to the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
we can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
and before i launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview , i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design .
the rca is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint .
we were discussing with keith <unk> <unk> this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations , otherwise they &apos;re afraid of being considered dumb <unk> .
but here instead are examples , you can already <unk> textiles , which is very interesting .
so it &apos;s really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us .
no . so i had to think a little harder .
we did this exact same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to face as physicists .
we can push it up : the forces become more fragmented ; there is more of them , but they are weaker .
naturally 7 : a <unk> <unk>
and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue .
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what &apos;s right about life , what &apos;s right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
and , as many people do , he was <unk> off during the sermon .
every week , the cleaner would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve answered my plea again . &quot;
it &apos;s the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> is how we refer to that .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- which are , frankly , not very effective for this kind of pain .
then you &apos;re starting to get an idea of how much rock we &apos;re talking about , okay ?
it was 1908 . that &apos;s fine . i can live with that .
i don &apos;t even know if you can see that in the back row . these are just stars .
in the year 2005 , nasa launched a probe called deep impact , which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future .
at that time i was running <unk> , the only independent , for that matter the only electronic media , in the country .
and i thought that <unk> will survive and be a great company once <unk> is gone , which turned out to be true .
at the end of the meeting he says , look , it is not going to work ; you will never see your money back ; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea .
and we said , that &apos;s fine ; let &apos;s meet ; you &apos;ll bring us your business plan , which eventually they did .
you see we started working in eastern and central europe , and moved to russia .
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center .
and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds , press freedom bonds .
and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms , no blind people running around to find each other .
now , why does stuff like that work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some people call that a theory of everything .
a trivial example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things <unk> .
the more and more symmetry you have , the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
one thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today , but in his day it wasn &apos;t taken for granted .
it doesn &apos;t diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things , plus accidents .
but he read books in every spare moment he could find .
so fueled by that ambition , he returned to the state <unk> .
but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had <unk> a thousand hands that morning at a new year &apos;s reception .
not that peculiar -- there were only three women out of the 16 white house fellows .
but i must say , the older i &apos;ve gotten , the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man .
and as lincoln told the story , mr. allen went to britain after the war .
so i went to my father in tears , &quot; what are we going to do ? &quot;
which is why , in the end , i shall always be grateful for this curious love of history , allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past .
he &apos;d <unk> , <unk> the temple .
this is the <unk> , this object is the evidence for the fact that the jews , after the exile in babylon , the years they &apos;d spent sitting by the waters of babylon , weeping when they remembered jerusalem , those jews were allowed to go home .
all of those are respected by cyrus .
the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of <unk> , marduk .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it .
others know more about the living conditions there , but still think they &apos;re a necessary evil .
the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were <unk> , <unk> , and staring into space like all the others .
one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i &apos;d been messing around with a camera most of my life .
you very quickly work out what is it that you &apos;ve got to do to <unk> that out .
there were <unk> people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
and we were listening to everybody .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i &apos;m delighted that this man , <unk> <unk> , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get unicef involved .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc . , etc . -- and they made it real .
linking up with the olympics -- i went and saw <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; london 2012 is about truce .
it &apos;s about your <unk> ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
so the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able .
i &apos;ve been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and i could never find it .
it is just a large primate brain .
and remarkably , that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago , when they invented cooking .
these were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations i was having .
and i feel like i &apos;ve just got started .
but as soon as the fighting intensified , the physical rehabilitation was suspended .
behind him there was a child , his son , red in the face in an effort to push the father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
in the evening , i went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters , and i told them -- i lied -- i told them , &quot; listen , we are going to start a couple of hours per day , just a few repairs . &quot;
two groups of mujahideen started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , taller again .
physical therapies can be done , not only in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of the people .
and you should see me during the match .
and that hospital could have afforded <unk> .
why ? because the path i had taken was considered out of bounds .
but i learned something more profound than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of ghana &apos;s economy -- were making <unk> bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse .
because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to bring the experience that i had at swarthmore to africa .
am i out of time ? ok .
we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball -- that sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
as a matter of fact , this is something that about half of you , more than half of you will not be familiar with .
<unk> tablets of calms <unk> .
good bye . &quot;
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
a professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
what is homeopathy ?
we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local authorities to get them to do something .
thank you .
so it runs frequently , the entire hospital , just on a generator .
there has to be something better . &quot;
but this gives control to the provider , whether there &apos;s power or not , because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they &apos;re giving their patient .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
the different types of writing in africa , first was <unk> , as illustrated by <unk> , which is the writing system of a secret society of the <unk> people in southern nigeria .
that is , until 1998 , when one yale professor john coleman <unk> discovered these inscriptions in the <unk> desert on the limestone cliffs in western egypt , and these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 b.c. , centuries before mesopotamia .
nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation .
not bad .
i like animals , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were <unk> .
and fancy food was entirely french .
if we had a slide of <unk> steak , even more so , right ?
it wasn &apos;t all bad .
let me pose you a question .
some of us might think that would be a good thing .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; knowing what i know , why am i not a vegetarian ? &quot;
on the weekend , your choice .
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes .
she kept getting distracted . he eventually won the race .
can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big , but it &apos;s a very neglected area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art .
human nature would have to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsically valuable .
might be more complicated in humans , but perhaps not that much .
jh : is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
so that told me right away : i need a remote control device .
you &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the <unk> force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .
so i think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
it &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
so we take the pizza , our very first pizza , and we devour slice after slice as the <unk> stands there and stares at us from the doorway .
i was in my 20s before i ever went to an art museum .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
this isn &apos;t photoshopped .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; love nests . &quot;
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
and also they reference how the <unk> -- everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit .
he &apos;s an australian aboriginal elder , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it ties to origami . so let me start .
that is , people applied mathematical principles to the art , to discover the underlying laws .
or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag , with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
so we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles , you <unk> the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules . that gives you the folds .
you can make multiple subjects .
but if you want to go higher and go larger than this , then you might need some origami .
and that works whether you &apos;re going into space , or whether you &apos;re just going into a body .
i grew up in a log cabin in washington state with too much time on my hands .
and we &apos;ve only got three minutes , but we could talk about it for hours .
and this is why i like to talk about this , because if we don &apos;t acknowledge it , then the transition will be pretty painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see on this graph -- it begins in 1973 , just before women start flooding the workforce , and it brings us up to our current day .
you would be issuing orders from above .
because i &apos;m writing a book about all this , i &apos;m still looking into it , so i don &apos;t have the answer .
and this was very disheartening for them .
now because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing .
there &apos;s no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .
whereas the personal income , on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation , has more than doubled , almost tripled , in that period .
and in order to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
it happens also , actually , in the most recent book i wrote , called &quot; good business , &quot; where i interviewed some of the ceos who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical , very socially responsible .
control is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfortable , but not very excited .
means &quot; where were you born and raised and educated ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of <unk> , assigned to them at birth , and didn &apos;t have much chance of stepping outside of that .
more and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past .
and i went down to the room in which i was to be sleeping .
<unk> <unk> : where is home ?
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
and let me show you why by converting back to the <unk> digital technology .
child survival is the new green .
and they were competitive about this : &quot; you <unk> , your rates of heart disease are shocking . &quot;
but if you give people vitamin d supplements , you don &apos;t change that high rate of heart disease .
and i first off started work in cell culture , growing cells , and then i was using <unk> mouse models -- mice that couldn &apos;t make the gene .
one of the subjects here was my mother-in-law , and clearly i do not know her age .
in summer , you might as well be at the equator .
certainly many advances , many lives saved .
and this is actually real photography , timed photography , showing how that limb <unk> in a period of days .
and then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this <unk> <unk> .
a blood vessel is made up of two different cell types .
we place it back into this oven-like device .
again , fairly more complex organs , but by far , the most complex solid organs are actually the <unk> , highly <unk> , a lot of blood vessel supply , organs such as the heart , the liver , the kidneys .
and that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .
we are just taking five seconds .
every problem that &apos;s out there , somebody has the idea for .
it &apos;s probably why i &apos;m a little bit panicked right now -- other than all the caffeine that i &apos;ve had and the sugar -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to an mba program .
i sold license plate protectors door to door .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you &apos;d make these chairs .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . &quot; you just figure out a way to make more money faster .
so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses .
and then they don &apos;t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of negotiating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service , show them what bad customer service looks like .
these guys , grasshopper .
the progression of today &apos;s college student is to jettison every interest except one .
mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy <unk> vast numbers of our students .
the value of the past also comes alive ; it provides a lot of company .
but it is a politics of principle , not of <unk> .
you have a mind . and you have other people .
but the thing i want you to think about when we think about conservatives -- not so much this issue of the 1980 convention -- the thing to think about is this : they go to church .
now , i know you don &apos;t believe me , really , here .
and it &apos;s not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end , it &apos;s that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other .
wildly different .
actually , it &apos;s not a right-wing nonprofit , but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the creative commons , which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often that happens .
he told me that he &apos;d invite the test subject in , and he &apos;d say , &quot; you know , there &apos;s a snake in the next room and we &apos;re going to go in there . &quot;
so i thought one of the things i &apos;d do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and <unk> were happy too .
i survived , just so you know .
i get asked all of the time from people , &quot; is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems ? &quot;
another facet of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in labs and in offices .
imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone .
and nobody knew anything about it .
and my company , owl built a system called guide for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference .
they wanted to put an end to it . and one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales .
78 percent of the votes , and to give you an idea of the <unk> , the next highest name pulled in three . okay ?
and that &apos;s the final message that i want to share with all of you -- that you can do well online .
so now , i suppose , i don &apos;t need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today .
this is the school , built with the community .
something we have in gando are clay pots .
that is it .
good morning . so magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good hand .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t run a country like china , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
and the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in china is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
it went for <unk> miles , linking beijing with <unk> and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the g20 <unk> very rapidly the position of the <unk> , or the g8 .
it travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
red = drums , blue = bass , green = chords , orange = leads , purple = pads the <unk> consists of ...
and the first song i wrote was in english , and the second one was in chinese .
she started singing her song .
i was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
&quot; you mean you &apos;re pasting an israeli face -- doing a face -- right here ? &quot;
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
are you an ngo ? are you the media ? &quot;
when the roofs were covered , a woman said as a joke , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photo .
but they asked me for a promise basically .
or , &quot; how can we help ? &quot;
and as i think about the mesh and i think about , well , what &apos;s driving it , how come it &apos;s happening now , i think there &apos;s a number of vectors that i want to give you as background .
they made it aspirational .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it &apos;s inviting participation , and cities have , historically , invited all sorts of participation .
it &apos;s very cost-effective , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
miniaturization as well .
this would imply a massive leap in migration .
it is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in ted , that the ideas that we think about look forward , and make sure that this will be the most glorious century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
the rest of my family are boring academics , busy collecting <unk> league <unk> for our classic ambassador car .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was <unk> <unk> , but something about that really stuck .
and i sat like you guys there in the audience .
this is another painting .
but this brought me -- with netra managing my career -- it brought me a lot of success .
i started exploring the darker <unk> of the human mind .
this time i said let &apos;s try something different .
so i said , okay .
sw : much better . well , einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 , amongst all you modern-day <unk> . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , remember ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
if i have an art , it &apos;s <unk> things that really scare the living hell out of me .
the body is denser than water . 95 percent of it would be , at least , submerged naturally .
and that will get you very far .
asked him what this said .
from that point , you can then , if you want to , acquire multiple languages , alternate them so there is no interference .
and she looked up and said , &quot; now that &apos;s better . &quot;
so i think you &apos;ll agree , they look quite good together .
and have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far -- built , i &apos;d say , about a half dozen schools , my readers , at this point .
and what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a short <unk> to the studio school
and finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy , and he goes up to saul and he says , &quot; i &apos;ll fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with <unk> .
goliath is a sitting duck . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era , and usually when someone is that far out of the norm , there &apos;s an explanation for it .
and there is , i think , in that , a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes , and those microbes actually do us good much of the time , rather than killing us .
cleaned out all the microbes , and then put it in the recipient .
most of the pills that you can take or the <unk> that you can eat have one or two species in them , maybe five species in them , and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species .
what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people , so that we can understand what they &apos;re doing to our lives .
a lot of people think in a very <unk> way on the internet , but for us , we &apos;re truly global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
so when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me , you think , oh , this is obviously just going to <unk> into rubbish .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk a lot about truth and objectivity .
and we have over 40 <unk> channels , 40 mailing lists .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s a nice starting point for quick research .
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .
in the jungles of guatemala , in <unk> , stands a temple .
it was told by an anonymous <unk> indian of southern alaska to a missionary in <unk> , and here it is .
it &apos;s way below your cognitive thinking process .
we found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses .
i &apos;ve got a girlfriend who &apos;s just getting over a terrible love affair .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we <unk> towards each other , we do what we call the &quot; <unk> gaze &quot; and we talk .
and they would be <unk> like <unk> , knives , <unk> and axes that i covered up with a piece of towel .
you see , i searched far and wide , but never bothered to look close and near .
and in some parts of the world , they use tools , like sponges to hunt fish .
so dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance .
you see , they &apos;re <unk> with their partner as well as the other <unk> .
but we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard .
now this dolphin , we call her &quot; the scarf thief , &quot; because over the years she &apos;s <unk> with about 12 <unk> .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we &apos;re also planning to put those back into the <unk> system .
and it &apos;s a <unk> word .
there is yves rossy .
and especially when you take a tracking position , you have the feeling that you are flying .
yr : actually , i try to stay just fit .
i did use that during these last 15 years about 20 times -- never with that type of wing , but at the beginning .
let &apos;s not tell you employer .
but it was too <unk> and full of <unk> on top .
wondering , therefore , how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen .
because that event was the scientific revolution , ever since which our knowledge of the physical world , and of how to adapt it to our wishes , has been growing <unk> .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
yours comes from guesswork , ours from the bible . &quot;
there is such a thing as a defect in a story .
and it &apos;s only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it &apos;s testable .
glasses are not very expensive . they &apos;re quite plentiful .
there are about 30,000 in use now .
what was this place called minto ?
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
she had gathered with others to watch &apos; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &apos; and , you know , it just made all the difference . &quot;
well , no <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> doctor : you feeling <unk> or dizzy at all ?
i thought , my career &apos;s over .
this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores .
this is a piece of <unk> ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you pictures of <unk> whales , <unk> whales , and <unk> , and polar bears , and leopard seals today , but this picture right here means more to me than any other i &apos;ve ever made .
and people were like , &quot; we knew they were vicious . we knew they were . &quot;
and this seal is taking this penguin by the head , and it &apos;s flipping it back and forth .
she went off , she got a penguin .
she &apos;s trying to <unk> my camera , which is every photographer &apos;s dream .
paul <unk> : tales of <unk> <unk>
now open your eyes .
do you have your ring as well ?
now this is a task for you to focus on .
joe , we &apos;re going to keep doing this till you catch it .
yeah , it &apos;s funny . we &apos;ve got a little guy . he &apos;s union . he works up there all day .
like i said , it shapes your reality .
and we worked together first with building and growing ushahidi .
it costs me five kenyan shillings , or <unk> <unk> to call the u.s. , canada or china .
it &apos;s built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have internet connectivity even in very remote areas .
over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in italy .
please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re libertarian .
the best definition of <unk> i &apos;ve ever seen -- this just <unk> so many things for me -- is from the brain scientist gary marcus .
we get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
but look at the other three lines .
aren &apos;t those just the foundations of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
it shoots up and it keeps going up .
and they say , &quot; keep your laws off my body . &quot;
you have the markings of <unk> on the right , <unk> &apos;s the liberal god . and they work together .
and so i think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
but if they respond , there &apos;s a range of other people around , who are innocent people who might also get hurt -- be collateral damage that the military often doesn &apos;t want to talk about .
we &apos;re looking at something different , &quot; and didn &apos;t seem to recognize , in fact , they were looking at pretty much the same stuff .
anyone want to take a stab at the number of times , given how they &apos;ve introduced this , the number of times police in queensland used o.c. spray in that period ?
there were , in fact , only a couple of people who got shot in this episode .
so she &apos;s 72 , and it &apos;s seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her .
so if you threaten to use it , people are going to <unk> with it , but it &apos;s also going to be something that doesn &apos;t leave any lasting effects . &quot;
we have begun organizing makers at our maker <unk> .
<unk> , or billy bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here to meet other people doing what he &apos;s doing .
this is <unk> .
and we &apos;ve got to get this into schools , or into communities in many , many ways -- the ability to tinker , to shape and <unk> the world around us .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and actually , we see glamorized photos of stars all the time -- they call them false color .
she &apos;s not looking away from you exactly , but you have to mentally imagine her world .
<unk> that curve away from you are glamorous .
but there &apos;s always this illusion that if you buy this lamp , you will live in a world without cords .
the perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect <unk> , the perfect diamond ring .
because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive .
but i also knew how hard they worked all week .
i did this in front of many strangers .
i heard about women being <unk> in their beds , <unk> in their <unk> , left for dead in parking lots , acid burned in their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found out i had cancer .
and my friend was preparing this big bowl , and i said , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
it was advocating friends and a <unk> sister .
so ill equipped are we all , to envision one another &apos;s interior workings and invisible aims . &quot;
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
rs : oh . so now joshua goes off to get a drink .
rs : should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua &apos;s sandwich ?
and she puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee .
first , i &apos;m going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse .
please tell me that you &apos;re not taking phone calls from the pentagon , say .
but why does anyone have to feel anything ?
and it was for , you guessed it , speed yoga .
and the second is , is it possible , or even desirable , to slow down ?
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy .
but the new idea , the sort of revolutionary idea , of the slow movement , is that there is such a thing as &quot; good slow , &quot; too .
and i now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my <unk> list , something that i <unk> , because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly .
and so the process began and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t put it all on an island ; some of it has to be on the mainland because we don &apos;t want to turn our back to the community . &quot;
i worked on it for months and i couldn &apos;t deal with it because i felt people were coming out of the historic museum , they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information , it would make them just unable to digest .
and then i went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking .
but one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site .
moshe safdie : building uniqueness
so if christian played a note -- like play an f.
so jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
do i matter , or really exist for you ?
they went through a lot to get here .
and in the summer india heats up , gets very hot .
and then the adult , which comes after , lives for one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know at the time , but i know now , they &apos;re globe <unk> , hundreds of them .
i got a little bit curious . in fact i &apos;ll stop here , because i want to ask , and there is a lot of people who , from india of course , people who grew up spending your childhood here .
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
okay , they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are , the monsoon rains .
just last week the rains broke . the short rains broke and it &apos;s raining there now .
a quite incredible feat .
incredible . this is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey . a quite incredible migration .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
and everyone thought i was good . but in this new terrain , i was horrible . so people would go , &quot; oh , he &apos;s all -- oh , what happened to <unk> ? &quot;
and so the night before my surgery , i &apos;d watched , and i was like , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
so , next — oh , mind you . those are the community .
so i &apos;ve had some success . and in the end , when you &apos;ve had all of these things , what is it that continues to drive you ? as i mentioned , the knee stuff and these things , what is it that will punch you ?
i last did a tedtalk i think about seven years ago or so .
but carl norden is really the one who cracks the code .
and whenever the norden bombsight is taken onto a plane , it &apos;s <unk> there by a series of armed guards .
and the chemical plant comprised <unk> acres .
and after the war was over , there was an audit done -- as the army always does , the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many <unk> did we actually destroy ?
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
you walk down the street in any big city , you travel like that , and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species .
what we &apos;re asking about though is human ancestry .
but based on what data ?
and imagine copying that by hand .
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world .
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now .
people who would have specialized in killing the animals , hunting the animals on those meat locker <unk> , moving up , following the grasslands into the middle east around 45,000 years ago , during one of the rare wet phases in the sahara .
the human genome project , or a mars rover mission .
and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity .
so let &apos;s do it .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas .
that operates over smaller scales than gravity , which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets .
you &apos;ll be familiar with the double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
and in the last 200 years , something else has happened .
now you might ask , what is behavioral finance ?
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
and then they have to decide how they &apos;re going to invest in their 52 choices , and they never heard about what is a money market fund .
well that &apos;s at least what one wonderful study predicted .
but when you get your driving license , you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken away .
save more tomorrow makes it easy .
this is just one example .
this is a song about a creature called a hummingbird <unk> which <unk> another creature which <unk> yet another creature .
hello . who &apos;s there , please ?
thank you all .
knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom .
i &apos;m trying to buy time .
so what did i do ?
we create stories to define our existence .
and what they did was , they sent walter raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self .
are you with child ?
elizabeth : get out ! get out ! get out !
i went to see a friend of mine , and he made me wait in his apartment in <unk> hill on the twentieth floor , which is a really , really <unk> area in mumbai .
everything &apos;s a contradiction .
we lived on less than a dollar a day for about 15 years .
and you &apos;ve got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as <unk> . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake a person who &apos;s pretending to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about lifestyles .
if they should all be sustainable on a finite planet , how do you make that happen ?
we need coke to work with pepsi .
this is nine of them .
we eventually got , i think , 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand at the table .
that &apos;s not insignificant .
but they &apos;re not just buying the juice ; they &apos;re also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into europe .
they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord , thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg .
it took many years , but eventually we developed an electrochemical <unk> that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state .
it took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal .
after a few weeks of recovery , we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized <unk> cocktail directly to the spinal cord .
and i was the product of a working-class community .
he talked about &quot; the world as it is &quot; and &quot; the world as it should be . &quot;
and having done so , these women moved many obstacles .
in the white house , there &apos;s the desk that he sits at -- it &apos;s called the <unk> desk .
on my last day , the woman who looked after the place , she came and we spoke for a minute , and then she said to me , &quot; would you sing something for me ? &quot;
to me , this piece is an ode to the voice because it &apos;s mysterious -- as we can see -- it &apos;s quite spontaneous , and it &apos;s primal .
they had none of that .
so the internet needs addressing and directions .
one of the most popular websites in the world , run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google were particularly privileged to do about it .
and today , wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus .
and wikipedia has embraced this .
so this is a blog devoted to unfortunate <unk> .
why ? there is the craigslist <unk> board .
and the world didn &apos;t stop in the 1990s .
and we see that in some countries , the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very , very strong .
all that costs money .
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage .
how do the media talk about schools and teachers ?
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching .
you know , some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving <unk> .
but if you look , if you have that perspective , then you can see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man .
so obviously this was a gadget to have .
so we could do that for telephones .
and it &apos;s a business for her .
&quot; the government needs to provide economically viable services . &quot;
once upon a time , at the age of 24 , i was a student at st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my map if i get it up here . you know ?
and i also bring an innovation here .
in the 1930 &apos;s now , you can see that japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy .
washington , d.c. went out here .
the bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to asia ?
the rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that cannot account for the mass either .
now , take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe , ok , a three-dimensional space .
and again , this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing .
they &apos;re moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger , ok .
so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they -- their number density , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .
the big questions facing physics .
sleepy man banjo boys : bluegrass <unk> from ... new jersey ?
so recycling and reuse are the major issues here .
marc <unk> : <unk> reasons to <unk> the syringe
and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , in addition to a lot of children .
in uganda we see the prevalence went down .
that suggests it &apos;s pretty similar levels of development .
but openness and <unk> , it comes with a cost when we think about disease . i don &apos;t think this should be a surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s major export .
emily <unk> <unk> the stats on aids in africa from an economic perspective and reaches a stunning conclusion : everything we know about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but it was fascinating to me , because i was looking at this sort of fine italian end papers .
it was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front , but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave , and then it would create like a sonic boom when it <unk> .
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .
and then we wonder why the membrane <unk> and why it takes so much electricity .
<unk> nanoparticles in a material for instance , always .
at biomimicry guild , which is my consulting company , we work with <unk> architects .
janine benyus : biomimicry in action
&quot; well , why ? &quot;
we were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys .
you can &apos;t do a thing about it .
it &apos;ll never happen again in india , because now it was once and forever .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; all right , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners .
secondly is about the <unk> movement in india .
let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of captcha .
basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
and in fact , the number of sites that are using recaptcha is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re <unk> per day is really , really large .
some of them are <unk> .
so right now the web is <unk> into multiple languages .
then comes my favorite part of the question .
there &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
but perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
the incorporated side , the company , is doing things that it does really well .
building these platforms for participation are so <unk> to do .
and zipcar provides a very nice , consistent service that works fabulously .
aristotle called happiness &quot; the chief good , &quot; the end towards which all other things aim .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing .
ten percent of the time people &apos;s minds are wandering when they &apos;re having sex .
i was playing the violent african , the african terrorist .
now the first round of the voting didn &apos;t bring forth a clear winner -- so nobody had achieved the absolute majority -- so voting went into a second round three weeks later .
now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
and i moved down to la jolla and learned how to surf .
and people in the 17th century , they didn &apos;t really understand the same way we do about you know , this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules , and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that .
and so , charles said , i &apos;m going to put up the money give you guys a building , come here and you can meet in the building , but just don &apos;t talk about religion in there .
i mean , reality is what you can see .
i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .
just to see what would happen , if you mixed it together .
so , so i &apos;ve got something else that &apos;s not personal .
you want to be rich , you be a businessman .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it isn &apos;t going up -- it &apos;s not going up at all . we &apos;ve doing it very carefully now for 20 years , from satellites , and it isn &apos;t going up .
biochemist kary mullis talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . sharing tales from the 17th century and from his own <unk> days , mullis celebrates the curiosity , inspiration and rigor of good science in all its forms .
i wanted a simple way to represent a living body <unk> these <unk> , <unk> spaces .

i love to travel , and berlin has become one of my favorite cities .
and all this time , i never saw a single rat in any of these places , until recently , when i was in the london sewers .
so the first question , and you might want to write this down , either on a bit of paper , physically , or a virtual piece of paper in your head . and , for viewers at home , you can try this as well .
and we <unk> it with , &quot; we are the premier science university in the world , &quot; because of <unk> hubris .
except , in your -- you &apos;re nodding -- now , in your ellipse , have you thought , &quot; well , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and it &apos;s one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works , it &apos;s quite difficult to shift those .
and as an inorganic chemist , my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic , living world and the inorganic , dead world .
and you can see , it &apos;s kind of pollinating , <unk> , growing .
in fact , we have such amazing <unk> that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself <unk> in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big <unk> molecules the same size of dna and proteins , but there &apos;s no carbon in sight .
we want to put it out in the environment , and we want it to be powered by the sun .
and i think , if we can make inorganic biology , and we can make matter become evolvable , that will in fact define life .
there &apos;s a second reason i like these development goals , and that is because each and every one is measured .
and this is highly professional female <unk> who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about &#91; her &#93; birth history .
i was actually , on friday , sitting in front of my computer , and i saw the death rate fall from <unk> to 84 just that morning .
you know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
you can see it doesn &apos;t make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
they had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
they have here qatar .
the big residual is always value for money .
yes , i went barefoot until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; question the <unk> .
all the time , you have been given an envelope .
and gandhian engineering , in my judgment , is the one which is going to take the world forward , is going to make a difference , not just for a few , but for everyone .
... above the limb , yes , it would be difficult ...
time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he had said , &quot; earth provides enough to satisfy every man &apos;s need , but not every man &apos;s greed . &quot;
and infants die .
it was &#91; unclear &#93; high school .
when i was at council of scientific industry research -- 40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other , i would &#91; unclear &#93; .
they agreed , and now i have apps on the app store .
it &apos;s about perfecting something old , and bringing something old into the 21st century .
it &apos;s still <unk> hot but it &apos;s not radioactive .
so the core of this reactor , since it &apos;s not under pressure and it doesn &apos;t have this chemical <unk> , means that there &apos;s no <unk> for the fission products to leave this reactor .
i think that i &apos;ve designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy , provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications , and i &apos;m really prepared to do this .
so we &apos;re shifting to an experience economy , where experiences are becoming the <unk> economic offering .
there &apos;s a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods .
at the end of a laundry list of advice he &apos;s giving to his son , <unk> , he says this : and this above all : to <unk> own self be true .

that &apos;s when you &apos;re perceived as fake , as a <unk> company -- <unk> things that you &apos;re not .
when i was a very young child , i was extremely introverted and very much to myself .
and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point .
so i &apos;ve invented it in concrete , because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and that was that tool .
and to me , that &apos;s the most important thing because , ever since being a kid , i &apos;ve wanted to communicate my passion and love .
25 days : heart chamber developing 32 days : arms &amp; amp ; hands are developing 36 days : beginning of the primitive <unk> these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today .
because apparently you can &apos;t have this fragile <unk> of <unk> in the atmospheres of sun-like stars .
now , what we can do with the spectra ?
the other day , my colleague from berkeley , <unk> <unk> , emailed me a very interesting spectrum , asking me , &quot; can you have a look at this ? &quot;
you have two channels -- the massive stars and <unk> stars -- producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe .
because can you imagine everything boiling ?
now imagine an object , amazing object , or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say , &quot; look , we give up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen , i think we have the perfect e.t.
i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
the things i can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
i have a slight office supply addiction , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this .
and i said , &quot; but here &apos;s the thing : no family stuff , no childhood shit . &quot;
what makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . shut up .
we pretend that what we do doesn &apos;t have an effect on people .
people were tracking their food via twitter , their kids &apos; diapers on their iphone .
so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement , we also think about how they can be useful for <unk> , for <unk> , self-awareness , self-knowledge .
and i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do , which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare .
so , steven is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
these are why people pray .
i love here -- the <unk> implant , which was , again , the only patient &apos;s data that was online and available .
and here &apos;s another paper .
you don &apos;t have the blinding , you don &apos;t have data , it doesn &apos;t follow the scientific method .
it &apos;s the intent to treat curve .
but my brother didn &apos;t . my brother went straight down the line .
if we walk into the <unk> iceberg when we leave here today , we &apos;re going to bump into something a thousand feet tall , 76 miles long , 17 miles wide , and it &apos;s going to weigh two gigatons .
to change its state , by the way , takes two volts from a millisecond pulse .
we said , &quot; could you build this ? &quot;
we can do better than this .
but there &apos;s an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity .
as a result , networks are ideal representations of complex systems .
and it has implications for systemic risk .
this allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder .
we &apos;re seeing the emergence of long-term and <unk> programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view .
in water pipes , we have <unk> water pipes that have fixed flow rates , except for expensive pumps and valves .
and we built 500 of these glass <unk> .
so no human interaction .
so we were up on top of our bunk beds .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean anything ; it &apos;s fake data .
and very quickly , my brain starts to think that &apos;s the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world .
because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if i know everything about your external world , i can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
and the problem is it &apos;s scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
we get people , when they open up their inbox , to write one positive email <unk> or thanking somebody in their social support network .
i can &apos;t tell you -- family business story : you &apos;d understand this -- my father was the most sincere man possible .
so i kind of switched . i went to mit , finished .
they were saying , make it stop now .
they &apos;re picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard .
he was the first digital media producer in tokyo .
do you hear that ? it &apos;s like cows . this is at 4 a.m. at logan .
so anyways , there are all these things you can do , but the thing i love the most is to experience , taste the world .
and i went after it with passion .
their culture isn &apos;t working in schools , and i &apos;m going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem .
this makes university administrators very nervous , because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools that don &apos;t have boys .
and little moments in my life .
are there moms who &apos;ve raised boys around that table ?
we need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools .
and they say these things as if it &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
we think that this these &quot; why &quot; questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature .
and i &apos;m going to try and show that at the end , and the suspense will be as much mine if it works .
and that &apos;s kind of been a big lesson to me , that you can &apos;t act on any object .
so for example , we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
so it &apos;s wirelessly linked to my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s running on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add an interaction system . so what i did was , i added a proximity sensor , so that when you get close to the people in jars , they react to you in different ways .
from my current self , i &apos;m turned into a middle-aged man , and then , from there , into an elderly man .
within the light sport aircraft category .
radio : what did you think of that ?
just fold up the wings and keep going .
so i &apos;ll ask you another question .
and he planted it in a royal potato patch , with guards who had instructions to guard over it , night and day , but with secret instructions not to guard it very well .
because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people &apos;s behavior .
however , what we do have now is a much more <unk> media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value , and it &apos;s much fairer .
now , if we have all these tools at our disposal , we simply have to ask the question , and thaler and <unk> have , of how we can use these more intelligently .
so they are introducing new diamond shreddies .
they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities .
i felt my passion , heart and soul , had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not without .
all around us , still <unk> drifting about in its primeval soup of culture , is another replicator .
you probably went out and bought them .
imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes .
we alone are gene machines and meme machines as well .
i think that &apos;s the wrong way to think about it .
that was dangerous , all right .
they are using us to suck up the planet &apos;s resources to produce more computers , and more of all these amazing things we &apos;re hearing about here at ted .
and will we get through this third danger point , like we got through the second and like we got through the first ?
working with <unk> , which is the u.n. mission in haiti , with the ministry of public works , with different ngos , we inspected over 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us any more to do it the right way . &quot;
and because i had 70 percent of my body burned , it would take about an hour .
and it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of <unk> from the pain .
and how much punishment would i get if i get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the commandments -- cheated less , and the less religious people -- the people who couldn &apos;t remember almost any commandments -- cheated more .
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
here is the thing .
i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
but trust me , i work in advertising .
these are the more polite ones i could share with you today .
and suddenly you &apos;re getting amazon , as a brand , is going head to head with the federal reserve in terms of how you want to spend your money , what money is , what constitutes money .
and you think , is it much of a leap ?
now i &apos;m sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- i did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week -- penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like this <unk> , indeed most animals , don &apos;t support their tissues by <unk> them over bones .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
everyone i showed it was really surprised at this .
a happy song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well i guess i have to now .
all right , okay .
will we play a tune ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> : these are the virtues of a great education .
the <unk> community went bananas over this project , and ben became an instant media celebrity .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
i was forced to leave the democratic republic of the congo , my home , where i was a student activist .
but remarkably , the u.n. environmental <unk> has estimated the wealth of the country to be over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not there yet .
they &apos;d have to be available at very competitive rates .
but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market ?
they asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes , and in a lot of cases they got it .
but let &apos;s suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid .
because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going to start making their return .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed .
we &apos;ve known about fusion since <unk> , when sir arthur stanley <unk> and the british association for the advancement of science <unk> that that &apos;s why the sun shines .
okay . what is fusion ? here comes the nuclear physics .
and that energy is what powers fusion .
and we get within about the same price as current electricity .
we have to get to a power plant .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also one with a great deal of influence .
while aspiring to democracy the most , they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually <unk> their opinion to a public official in the last month -- at only four percent .
but people &apos;s expectations for their future went up significantly .
so the question becomes , what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ?
i promise she read that text .
no one hears you in a stall , you &apos;re just texting quietly .
you could see the immediate impact of legislation or a <unk> speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result .
the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet .
that &apos;s an unnatural act for a rocket .
it weighs less than one aa battery .
from the smallest <unk> of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s storms .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
we think someone else , someone smarter than us , someone more capable , someone with more resources will solve that problem .
we didn &apos;t fly it into the pacific .
it took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly .
and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what &apos;s possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means .
let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
and the warden was quite amused , and he told me he thought that i was a nut and he told me , &quot; this place is a correction facility . these guys are serious offenders .
it took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning <unk> .
and you look down at <unk> ; everything is so small and tiny .
and i feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago i had the courage to <unk> my <unk> position at nyu and return to my home country where i can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from ethiopia and morocco and russia .
and how many times would my self have to die before i realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
and i was a really good dancer .
strangely , these revelations didn &apos;t cure my low self-esteem , that feeling of otherness .
it &apos;s because i didn &apos;t have a self to get in the way .
imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self , appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next .
and this is a cafe by the sea in britain .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this .
but we realized that seeds -- there &apos;s been this very serious project happening -- but that seeds -- at these major botanical gardens , seeds aren &apos;t on show .
we worked with an astroturf manufacturer to develop a <unk> version of the seed cathedral , so that , even if you &apos;re <unk> , that it was kind of <unk> and soft , that piece of landscape that you see there .
it &apos;s actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience , and the rest of it is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate , &quot; based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate , and that all of its structure comes from socialization , culture , parenting , experience .
well , there are a number of political reasons why people have found it <unk> .
it &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate generalization , but the data at the time seemed to support that .
and the humanities and arts programs in the universities , which by many measures , indeed are in decline .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
and i think that the argument can &apos;t be put any more eloquently than that .
i also call <unk> , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it -- but they confirm it .
there &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no <unk> , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he &apos;s like , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking right now . &quot;
&quot; oh , i &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; -- that &apos;s weird .
so i started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
right ?
it goes like this -- we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
your iphone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger , and now it &apos;s <unk> pages long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so is it true that you faked your way in here ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
so all the things that had seemed most normal about tony was evidence , according to his clinician , that he was mad in this new way .
he would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce , just turn american towns into ghost towns .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket .
and the gems are always the <unk> aspects of our interviewee &apos;s personality .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend was for <unk> with the rest of the world .
and as a consequence of this disagreement , it &apos;s very , very difficult for anyone to say , &quot; i have the right version of islam . &quot;
it may be that there was a great war to be fought between west and east , and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism .
and even though , for political tactical reasons , the president has been very , very good about saying that islam is not the enemy , nonetheless , there &apos;s a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy .
now when the treasure sank in 2000 , it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin -- which at the time , was listed as a threatened species .
so the day after we arrived , two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two , and room two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it .
and we used this technique again during the treasure rescue .
and this is critically important because , one year ago , the african penguin was declared endangered .
corner row railway , station car park , front of a health center , people &apos;s front gardens , and even in front of the police station .
people are ready and respond to the story of food .
so we launched a campaign -- because it just <unk> me -- called every egg matters .
this isn &apos;t a second class exercise .
these doctrines seemed unproven , abstract .
hillel stood on one leg and said , &quot; that which is <unk> to you , do not do to your neighbor . that is the torah . the rest is commentary .
now -- but that &apos;s not the whole story .
and then achilles takes the body of <unk> , he hands it very <unk> to the father , and the two men look at each other , and see each other as divine .
so when we would look at cells , this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope .
each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
and you can see those in <unk> .
that image was the start of the x-ray technology .
we all look the same inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete .
the one on the left is an x-ray .
it has human <unk> .
so the x-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners .
so , i &apos;ve got to saw the car in half , down the middle , not an easy task , in itself .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week , and after a week , they only used it as a bathroom .
science actually says we will live forever .
no , i just spit out a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much . goodbye .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
it is not professor and <unk> , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
and then life was fine , dandy .
and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the <unk> between the <unk> and the hunter-gatherers .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time investigating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty shocking , but more about that later .
and then there &apos;s dan etete .
and we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in london .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .
we all die . we all get old . we all get sick . people leave us .
you have places you cannot go , thoughts you cannot think , worlds that you can no longer inhabit .
they have a <unk> and a freedom that i believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm .
she made a decision not to go and get a <unk> or a glass shard , but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls .
all of us are refugees .
but you clamp this thing on my head , and something happens .
but you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
i miss michael .
he did not think so , however , but his coworkers did an intervention and they said , &quot; you are going to rehab , or you will be fired and you will die . &quot;
ahh ! we come upon them , the <unk> lovers . let &apos;s draw them out .
when it &apos;s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this .
the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this <unk> word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with <unk> and irrational thinking .
if i doubt my older sister &apos;s ability to pay back the 10 percent interest i established on her last loan , i &apos;m going to <unk> her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back .
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that &apos;s called <unk> .
this is after selective logging .
there are many facets to soundscapes , among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing , which i &apos;ll save for another time .
so this was extremely embarrassing .
and if you &apos;re wondering how much <unk> is , this ebay logo here is <unk> .
so 37 is our target audience .
it &apos;s very , very epic and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the kind of topics we really actually care about .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
these are all troubles outside of myself .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .
you &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . that &apos;s it .
he would have a great time .
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . we like more .
now she had them look at them and do this ... <unk> , which i thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think .
make it go in the other direction .
student <unk> : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
and thereby hangs a tale . &quot;
before it &apos;s all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have amazing impacts .
why do you do what you do ?
they &apos;ll want the new release .
they touch us too deeply .
and they are actually going to <unk> this moment in time .
again , i &apos;ll use the words in the same order he did .
and i said , &quot; well , funny you should ask .
and she said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t have to do that again . &quot;
and we watched them and i &apos;m so thankful , because she &apos;s just like , &quot; wow ! this is so amazing . &quot;
the project aim is really quite simple .
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
i was working with imperial and the <unk> , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn &apos;t exist .
so many people in the medical world don &apos;t want to change , particularly not when some <unk> engineer has come along with the answer .
you can find novel solutions , really novel solutions , that have never been looked at before very , very quickly and easily .
yeah well , you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round , a nice round shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i went to see the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice cartoons .
thank you .
well , &quot; rare earth &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second microbial age .
the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> here , and <unk> over here , and so much else .
this is the top <unk> , the <unk> of its time .
they hate we animals .
this is when <unk> material comes to the surface , spreads out over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m 80 miles from shore , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
you &apos;re in an accident . you &apos;ve got two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment , promote trade .
and the answer is quite simple : the chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities , not pharmaceutical facilities , so they don &apos;t audit them .
i don &apos;t know how to prevent that , but i &apos;m at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response . &quot;
you need a safe space .
we &apos;re now thinking that , in fact , this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges .
and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition : can i give this person their dignity back ?
or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place , to see if you can change him . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was hooked .
and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks .
after the race , he tossed his wet , <unk> hair and said , &apos; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot while i &apos;m teaching , and i don &apos;t always get to watch all of my students reach their step three , but i was very lucky with charlotte , that i got to watch her journey unfold the way it did .
my parents named me sarah , which is a biblical name .
i &apos;d like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer .
seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population <unk> the final phase of liberation from apartheid .
the next day i left for rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia , i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization .
an <unk> hospital in a camp for displaced people .
military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history .
to make sure as few things as possible go wrong , we have all these procedures around the election .
so this is how you vote .
but it &apos;s a broad and very delicate subject , so i have to limit myself .
the size is the population -- big china , big india here .
and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level .
because the death of a child is <unk> by one more child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they are quite useful for educational purposes .
all the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like everyone else in our generation , we went to live in a himalayan monastery .
day eight .
in india alone , my 150,000 best friends and i went door to door with that same picture to every single house in india . we made over one billion house calls .
that is the surveillance system .
i asked them -- these are all <unk> and specialists in influenza -- and i asked them the questions you &apos;d like to ask them .
and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude to gphin and to ron st. john , who i hope is in the audience some place -- over there -- who &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant : first of all , you &apos;re not mad about the copyright violation ?
i set up a climate change ngo called the climate group .
why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business ?
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old <unk> .
people sometimes think that 100 percent &apos;s going to be hard , and we &apos;ve had the conversation in the business .
a solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years .
so we know for our 17,000 managers across ikea that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management .
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual .
this , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the <unk> structure of reality . &quot;
anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you , or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears .
by the end of our lunch , we acknowledged each other &apos;s openness .
as always , i would return to bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend &apos;s homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained <unk> about the new pub <unk> , where a drink often cost more than what they &apos;d paid their 14-year-old maid .
he <unk> forgiveness , and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his <unk> .
this contingent seems to be quite lucky , and it has not sustained any casualties , even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s a worry -- isn &apos;t it ? -- that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
j yeah . so this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya , in tanzanian and south african press .
j the impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far -- i &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the ted audience .
and we were like , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the icelandic parliament <unk> .
and from all of these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it .
i first learned about it through a lawsuit i read about in my doctor &apos;s office -- which was between the physician &apos;s committee for responsible medicine and seven different fast food restaurants .
so the best way to <unk> chicken , based on this , is to , not <unk> , but definitely don &apos;t <unk> and <unk> the chicken , and <unk> in either lemon juice , brown sugar or saltwater .
and then went on , my next summer , to work under dr. <unk> at the <unk> health center at fort worth , texas .
and that &apos;s huge for chemotherapy effectiveness -- possibly for many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , homes and workplaces .
because these solutions are natural , these solutions are sustainable , and these solutions are long-term investments -- long-term investments that we &apos;re making for our generation and for future generations .
and immediately a voice <unk> , &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
and people would come up to me after the conference , after my talk , men and women .
heavy !
a prosthetic limb doesn &apos;t represent the need to replace loss anymore .
we are all different from different perspectives .
i was in beijing &apos;s bidding for the olympic games .
about 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
and they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , <unk> loans from banks , appreciation of the <unk> , or decline of demand from europe or america for the products they produce .
they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher gdp ?
there is nothing to eat up here , but the conditions were ideal for <unk> .
now , the series hasn &apos;t even aired yet , so you &apos;re the very first to see this .
more like mars than earth , it seems just as hostile to life .
sousa &apos;s fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these , quote , &quot; <unk> machines . &quot; they would take it away .
but most important was that bmi took public domain works and made arrangements of them , which they gave away for free to their subscribers . so that in 1940 , when ascap threatened to double their rates , the majority of broadcasters switched to bmi .
and i <unk>
now , the balance that i try to fight for , i , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . total mistake , right ?
that realization is extraordinarily corrosive , extraordinarily corrupting .
okay , now i don &apos;t want to alarm anybody in this room , but it &apos;s just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t look fat in that , no . &quot;
but in another study , it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
here &apos;s koko with her kitten .
i &apos;m going to say this again .
we think liars won &apos;t look you in the eyes .
we say &quot; yes , &quot; we shake our heads &quot; no . &quot;
science has <unk> many , many more indicators .
and if you look closely , you &apos;ll see <unk> delight throughout this video .
so in this much <unk> world , it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code .
which it isn &apos;t really , is it ?
you know , we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live , and i find that &apos;s not true .
so what seems like an <unk> if tragic joke about harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred .
six months after that , with no explanation , they let me go .
and this is the difficulty that i face .
when i was 10 , i read james <unk> &apos;s &quot; another country , &quot; and that book broke me .
now i have beaten a song back into you .
so that &apos;s why i took a bit of time to study coke .
and in africa , the remote places , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you <unk> them based on the impact that they &apos;re getting out in those remote villages ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; <unk> &apos; flag &quot; to me .
they &apos;re waiting to be <unk> .
so many more people would have been affected .
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine sanctuary .
if we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
after a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
if this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
so marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
what we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the <unk> , with five lions per <unk> .
well , <unk> , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . thank you .
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
they come right up to the submarine -- they &apos;ll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub .
one of the things we &apos;re trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world , this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory .
bl : these worms have no digestive system . they have no mouth .
what we saw up till now was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you high definition from the pacific .
the worms are growing inches per week !
the concept of preservation is futile .
and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
you also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
and the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
what ever happened to the small hadron collider ?
this is where you &apos;ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .
they &apos;re private schools . there are no state schools in slums .
this is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called sugata mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments , showing that children , in the right conditions , can learn on their own with the help of computers .
well , the key is motivation , and there are two aspects to it .
so this is a school in a bus on a building site in pune , the fastest growing city in asia .
you should turn it into mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal settings -- schools , colleges , hospitals -- in which innovation can take place , and informal settings -- communities , families , social networks .
every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school will be able to have one in 2015 .
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people -- they eat two , three , four dinners a night -- it &apos;s ridiculous !
it goes and goes and <unk> !
these gays , people like me , want to be treated like full citizens and it &apos;s all written down in plain sight .
there are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don &apos;t show anyone who they really are right here at home . this isn &apos;t just about north carolina ; all those states that were clear , it &apos;s legal .
think about that .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us become what we might have been .
evolution works that way .
and sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
i actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
not only will it raise itself to 115 fahrenheit , 43 or 44 degrees centigrade , for two days , but it keeps constant temperature .
but the contrast will look something like that , so standing out a lot from the background .
and this is when the americans beat the russians , and this was -- yes , it was technically a game .
so she proceeded to tell me , and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo <unk> here .
my history is irish .
our lives are being driven by data , and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories .
i started taking a look as well at different <unk> , because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data .
there &apos;s actually a <unk> man that sits in that box and controls this chess player .
approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour , which would make a working wage of <unk> cents per hour .
this basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame , and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they &apos;re doing .
daisy bell : daisy , daisy ... aaron <unk> : and we took all of those individual pieces , and we fed them into another turk request .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
and below it are all the individual frames that people have been <unk> to the project .
thanks a lot .
so i made series of images , <unk> , and i assembled them in <unk> .
so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image , so it makes a very freestyle architecture .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , such as the 2010 <unk> earthquake .
then i went to run <unk> , then <unk> .
so it &apos;s like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .
another glass project is in a public library in san jose , california .
so each building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living .
i don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
she &apos;s simply too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , when you met a very poor person , that person would be described as an &quot; unfortunate &quot; -- literally , somebody who had not been blessed by fortune , an unfortunate .
and he &apos;s going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and <unk> , and the skies will open .
i gave them the <unk> of madame <unk> .
what i think i &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the authors of our own <unk> .
alain de botton : a kinder , gentler philosophy of success
and when you &apos;re training for this sport , you are not smiling .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with the <unk> goggles , you &apos;re swimming at 60 strokes a minute , so you &apos;re never really focused on anything , you don &apos;t see well .
you &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
my breath is down to three <unk> a minute .
they should worry about me . i don &apos;t worry about them .
i was swimming with this thing on .
it &apos;s the only swim i &apos;m interested in .
this is already available today .
gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway , as today many of these things are dedicated <unk> , because they are not so well integrated .
a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life .
this is an important part of our life , one-third you &apos;re supposed to be sleeping .
ok . now let &apos;s move from sleep to diseases .
so , we can change medicine across the continuum of care , across the ages from <unk> or unborn children to seniors ; the pharmaceutical arena changes ; the full spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of that -- across the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more .
how do we make stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular one named alvin is created . and he says , maybe this isn &apos;t the best way , and <unk> the whole system .
and so there won &apos;t be any workforce .
and it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
<unk> ought to be faster .
now you might wonder , how do we make these <unk> ?
we have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it .
here &apos;s the final hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were <unk> , rather than physicians .
but eventually they did come around .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
i talked about the large , complicated robot .
and as you see it come out , in order to actually be able to do anything useful , it can &apos;t all stay clustered up like this .
and we don &apos;t even need to <unk> ourselves to this macro vision .
miranda <unk> : we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
mw : okay . well , it was partially my fault .
we have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution , but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries .
the film that we &apos;re about to see is a film they made for the moscow world &apos;s fair .
i &apos;m no exception .
it continued . they were always trying to make thing better and better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is curves . let &apos;s make the house <unk> . &quot;
and i think in our family we were very lucky , because we learned about design backwards .
dawn , very good .
ed : and then embassy row is actually a historical site , because in the <unk> story this is where the <unk> diaspora started , where there embassy was .
see that chair there ? the orange one ? that &apos;s the organic chair . 1940 .
because that &apos;s part of where we &apos;ve got to get to .
they were press pieces and they were full of outrage , they were full of speculation , they were anecdotal -- no solid information .
one we all know about , the population explosion : the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent lawson : happy to be here .
you can see that the lines cross when the population explodes .
well , first , before i even tell you the cost i &apos;ve got to be absolutely clear .
this is what liberation really looks like .
however , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking .
well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their movements dissipate energy , which breaks the <unk> state .
now , i can extend this circular magnet , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is from &quot; the <unk> &apos;s guide to the galaxy . &quot;
because , of course , they don &apos;t actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don &apos;t have a <unk> plant .
but even then they weren &apos;t convinced and said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll phone you back &quot; -- never did .
<unk> : yeah , i did plug it in .
so people say , &quot; what &apos;s going to happen when moore &apos;s law comes to an end ? &quot;
you can buy half a billion today , and they are actually better , because they are faster .
but where will we get the software ?
but larry page made an <unk> speech at our organizing meeting , saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity .
they were trying to catch fish .
this may seem minor , but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave , bigger than the last , will be coming at exactly 1 p.m. , or perhaps tonight , or perhaps ...
and so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment , a moment in which the blogosphere came , to a certain degree , of age .
it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar , and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you .
people have linked to it , and so other people in turn link to it , etc . , etc .
he finishes explaining that , and i &apos;m waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s what i want from you . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 30-second piece , and then i &apos;m done .
this type of habitat covers more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habitats combined .
now most of us , and i would say me included , think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to , perhaps , 100 years or so .
so these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they &apos;re our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom .
and so there &apos;s a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census .
we don &apos;t know why they converge there , we simply don &apos;t know .
now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that &apos;s going to come out in the journal <unk> biology .
and there are a lot of other pressures .
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build your home , grow it !
and i find that very interesting and very provocative , because what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions : directions that are specific and unique to problems .
now , we all think that <unk> obviously is the great romantic poet that he was ; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays , too , and the most <unk> essay is one called &quot; a <unk> of poetry . &quot;
and i &apos;ll read you what it is .
and at some point of its life , it implants on a rock .
but let me show you cutting-edge robotics .
so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard &quot; <unk> &quot; on the station you wanted to hear , that was the noise .
and the key idea to bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference .
so that really means i have to make predictions of the future .
well there &apos;s one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person .
and in the intervening years i had two daughters .
so they don &apos;t know the rules the other person &apos;s playing by .
if these dots were cars going on a racing circuit , you would have absolutely no idea what &apos;s going on .
so we &apos;ve shown that using this , we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise .
this is <unk> , <unk> iv .
mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system , <unk> basin .
this is my favorite picture . this was just taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest rock on earth is only 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a robotic <unk> airplane we call ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is over <unk> , oregon .
i think the box says -- let &apos;s see here -- &quot; 8 to 12 &quot; on it .
and there &apos;s a dude selling these <unk> weapons for lego , because lego -- the danish -- no , they &apos;re not into guns .
and then , just some examples . this stuff really is sculpture .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , for me , everything changed that evening .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
in fact , policy is <unk> .
they now have <unk> ethanol pumps -- this versus 700 in the u.s. , and a <unk> two in california -- and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent <unk> .
don &apos;t let me skip over that . better biofuels are a really big deal .
the scientists tell us -- and they &apos;re only guessing -- that we &apos;ve got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half , and do it as fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to see what we tedsters do about this crisis .
there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect , and then you get the plateau of the curve , and you get this classic sigmoidal curve .
b is located on the edge of the network .
and that happens at every peripheral node .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
would you get any <unk> immunity ?
and there are three ways , i think , that these <unk> data can be used .
the building was under construction until the collapse of the venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early &apos; 90s .
while it may appear to be a completely chaotic place , when you see it from above , there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home .
in this tradition , the <unk> displays all of their belongings , which they soon bring to their new husband .
what makes places like the <unk> david particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into .
and we can just ask : &quot; what are the names of santa &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask .
it &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
you can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
or even , as we get very much older , driving our cars to go visit people .
they were gone in an instant .
it was getting more and more apparent that we &apos;re fighting a losing battle .
the two wizards that i have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen .
and one of the journalists said to her , what &apos;s up ?
<unk> have joined it . jewish groups have joined it .
i think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly .
he was drawn to the flames , he chased the flames , he was like a <unk> to the flames . something of an <unk> junkie .
let me go <unk> to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation .
but it was too late for sergio .
he saw them .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about access to food , because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis , there was enough food on earth for everyone to have 2,700 <unk> .
and i go to those shops , if there are any , or out to the fields to see what they can get , and they cannot obtain the nutrition .
we see a transformation in attendance by girls .
i &apos;d like to talk about what i call digital food .
and what i &apos;ve found is , rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things , they invested in a school feeding program .
thank you .
we could do the same in cancer .
you will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic .
it &apos;s not in the abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a staggering device , not because it tells me how many <unk> i do every day , but because it looks , over 24 hours , what i &apos;ve done in a day .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the power of these magnets , the power of what we can do here , is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology .
you don &apos;t need to shrink the disease .
and so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution is high enough -- you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system .
most people find that very <unk> , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in <unk> .
you all recognize that one . this is the <unk> tune in the world today .
and i stood there beside two very good friends of mine , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
crossing miles and miles of <unk> -- frozen ice <unk> that could be <unk> .
as i stand here today talking to you guys , i &apos;ve been running for the grand sum of five years .
it was six miles offshore and <unk> feet down .
the ocean drives climate and weather , stabilizes temperature , shapes earth &apos;s chemistry .
one-way trips are easy .
this is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
in the last three years , for example , the u.s. protected <unk> square miles of ocean as national monuments .
we need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
well , i spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air .
and let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
so this is a beautiful image of a visual <unk> from a mouse that came from jeff <unk> &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
you select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior , another <unk> , another set of cells , a different pattern , and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very , very complicated system .
our mission is to build a detailed , realistic computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s at home having tea .
if you zoom into the surface of the neocortex , you discover that it &apos;s made up of little modules , <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they positioned ?
we can look at the fabric . and we can change neurons .
we can load up all the neurons , each one on to its processor , and fire it up , and see what happens .
henry <unk> says the mysteries of the mind can be solved -- soon . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electric signals , and he plans to find them with a supercomputer that models all the brain &apos;s <unk> synapses .
it would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs .
the air force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this .
so this is what nasa did , getting an eight man version that would go to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there is so much feedback you can get from people .
the bottom one ? yellow .
when you ask people this question , they usually think that it has to be something about culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
but pulling them back , all of the sudden becomes more complex .
an online subscription for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don &apos;t know our preferences that well .
in fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- due to eye safety regulations , can be only used with low power .
its intensity can be <unk> at very high speeds , and it can be switched off at very high speeds .
you &apos;re critical .
that &apos;s aside .
cars have <unk> headlights , <unk> back lights , and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
and one thing that is common to all of life is dna .
it &apos;s not really all that much data .
you will give your genome to the <unk> , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won &apos;t have side effects .
very simple -- only has about <unk> genes -- but we were able to completely synthesize that genome .
in other words , we &apos;re not , sort of , unique little organisms running around ; we are part of a big ecosystem .
now , we can create bad impacts -- we can poison ourselves ; we can poison the earth -- but that &apos;s just a natural outcome of a mistake we made .
now , i &apos;m here largely because there &apos;s kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that -- on one side , we have people who think that you train a dog , number one , by making up rules , human rules .
they are just so <unk> , and that &apos;s why they get beaten .
no , we go , &quot; puppy , sit &quot; -- boom , it &apos;s got it in six to 10 trials .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if it doesn &apos;t have to be , then maybe it shouldn &apos;t be .
not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
these relationship skills are so easy .
your kids are easy to train .
wk : i wanted to make a windmill .
and so , and that windmill , what -- it worked ?
wk : yeah . i &apos;m still thinking to work on energy .
because although i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical .
and rarer still when accompanied , as in my case , by self-awareness and a mastery of language .
one is a flash of white light .
64 multiplied by 75 .
let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals -- but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
that is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
but i &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
that &apos;s as high as a <unk> building , and i put the statue of liberty in there as a scale reference .
and we aren &apos;t talking about it -- we dismiss it .
they &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
when people think about making <unk> detection <unk> , usually it &apos;s the <unk> problem that &apos;s an issue , because how can we detect things if they &apos;re always changing ?
i talked about that -- you know , that situation where you go into the clinic and you don &apos;t get diagnosed ?
what about real people ?
we sequenced part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new rhinoviruses no one &apos;s actually even seen .
she came back after ten days of fever , right ? still has the fever , and she &apos;s hypoxic -- she doesn &apos;t have much oxygen in her lungs .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really sequenced that much .
it &apos;s a classic gamma retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new ; no one &apos;s ever seen it before .
a giant battery could .
instead , let &apos;s invent to the price point of the electricity market .
so i put <unk> liquid metal at the top , put a high-density liquid metal at the bottom , and molten salt in between .
but david &apos;s young and he &apos;s smart and he wants a ph.d. , and he proceeds to build -- he proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry .
so what have we learned from all this ?
so this video was taken at <unk> undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key <unk> , about 60 feet below the surface .
so we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation .
but i started getting very interested in maria montessori and her methods , and the way she went about things , and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things <unk> .
evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through , but really it represents this huge set of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip way ahead here to the space phase .
and our cities are going to be at risk too , because a lot of these are coastal cities .
but we also have stars and things as well .
so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
this expression , which is known as pride , jessica tracy has studied . she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are <unk> blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
so i started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating . is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
so this is in the lab . it &apos;s this little task , you know , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes . where can you actually apply this ? which we cared about , of course .
these kinds of things . people are bringing their true selves , basically . they &apos;re bringing themselves .
and she said , she came in totally defeated , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life .
salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds , and lancet <unk> <unk> a passing ant , crawl into its brain , and drive it up a blade of grass like an <unk> vehicle .
and you have to have a bumper sticker , you know . you have to have a statement .
so it is important , i think , to richard , and to me , that these ideas not be abused and misused .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
and , as with germs , the trick is not to try to <unk> them .
and in my game , that means you <unk> .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started touring them internationally .
i know you &apos;re going to say to me , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
no one &apos;s listening . no one &apos;s trusting .
and you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> revolt .
not to say that it shouldn &apos;t have , but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses .
they work in government offices . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars can save a life .
she makes about two dollars a day , is creating an education fund , and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed .
finally , in desperation , they went and they consulted a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as the saying goes , when angry , you will make the best speech you will ever regret .
okay , so the great majority of us .
his basic message was unity too , the interconnectedness of it all , the unity of it all , and his basic value was respect , was kindness toward strangers .
who fights while they walk ?
they &apos;ve begun to walk in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more walkers have come , and lately she &apos;s begun to earn an income to support her family .
just go up to someone who &apos;s from a different culture , a different country , a different ethnicity , some difference , and engage them in a conversation ; listen to them .
i &apos;m going to start where the story began , 1985 , in central australia .
this morning before you came , who could have had a wash using a shower ?
what you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those <unk> houses lived in by 50,000 indigenous people , 35 percent had a working shower .
<unk> percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction , literally things that are built upside down and <unk> .
we did it . he provided us dust monitors .
later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure .
the common link between all the work we &apos;ve had to do nelson mandela said , in the <unk> , not too far from here , he said that like slavery and apartheid , &quot; poverty is not natural .
i don &apos;t care if you call me a <unk> . i really don &apos;t .
it actually sounds really <unk> to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in practice , it &apos;s really powerful .
and with that note , i come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live , learn and earn in a better one .
and that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in america with our bronx <unk> president .
that &apos;s a picture i took of my bronx <unk> president , addressing my kids in his house , not the <unk> , making them feel a part of it .
so we started giving back .
and most importantly , when you put big kids together with little kids , you get the big fat white guy out of the middle , which is cool , and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers , which is incredible .
now , you may ask about these kids .
keep kids out of stores that look like this .
stephen ritz : a teacher growing green in the south bronx
second of all , i &apos;ll bet even you people who are <unk> can see the difference , and we see here an st segment elevation right after this sharp line .
this pig at 10 : 06 was having a heart attack .
the patients who have a migraine <unk> by an aura have a band of excited neurons -- that &apos;s shown in red -- that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the <unk> .
you see , the problem is , 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a means to treat it , and i think that we now have it .
the first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive <unk> , called <unk> , for responsive <unk> -- that &apos;s a brilliant acronym -- for the treatment of other brain disorders .
lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury , because this patient really ended up badly .
a year and a half ago , four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi , which means &quot; testimony &quot; in swahili , were ted fellows .
how do you decide what is important ?
so i thought , &quot; i will talk about death . &quot;
i took it out for the first time to come here .
and i &apos;m going to call these people below the barrier <unk> , because they &apos;re really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world .
they &apos;re going to be using connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in 84 countries that are around the world .
right , books that might sell 100 copies a year , 1,000 copies a year .
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody &apos;s getting into it , right ?
how do we protect it into the future ?
and so that isn &apos;t very hard .
the days of pilot projects are over , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works . &quot;
well , no , it &apos;s not a laptop project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s sort of an electronic book .
everybody says it &apos;s a $ 100 laptop ; you can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> .
they &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , no , no . here &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a great assembly line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think there &apos;s an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hiv-positive , she &apos;s going to infect her child .
it &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
you &apos;re going to be okay . you &apos;re going to live .
the first , to prevent <unk> transmission .
so , a couple years ago , one of the mentor mothers came back , and she told me a story .
how do you build a better health care system ?
what &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
so if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . it peaks in early adolescence .
the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave .
here &apos;s the <unk> that we built together .
it was invited , after the first year , by the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to have it installed in their lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say it remained online there , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but that night , as we were packing up , i asked the tele-actor , how did the <unk> decide that they would give a kiss to sam <unk> ?
and here &apos;s the result .
it &apos;s a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations .
now , i can tell you , i don &apos;t know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle , but it makes for <unk> .
now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the <unk> of the bite .
he wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
it was sort of a hollow in the ground .
and she was like , &quot; well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot;
well 200 years , we calculated , is at the end of our direct contact with the world .
it &apos;s so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my 200-year plan .
i like to think -- thank you .
and let me tell you , corn is in everything .
i want you to know that there are farmers &apos; markets in every community popping up .
i led three diving expeditions to antarctica .
but tell me where they are and the country that owns them . &quot;
and we explored the surface of the islands as well -- very important bird nesting site , some of the most important <unk> sites in the pacific , in the world .
we as a world are faced with a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine , but the coral , which everybody likes to look at , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific with large <unk> and large conservation zones on it .
now we have <unk> , instantaneous , automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices all the way down to smartphones .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no <unk> , no single answer to it . but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what do the data say ? &quot;
what happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community .
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually an yves klein painting .
i mean , that &apos;s , at least , how it made me happy .
well , there was a question , of course , that was on my mind for a while : you know , can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i don &apos;t like to be doing ?
this is from the front .
they face a cruel situation of no choice .
they &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
for example , as a 15-year-old , i was considered <unk> good at multiplying numbers because i had memorized the multiplication tables and i know how to use <unk> and i &apos;m quick at manipulating a slide rule .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s , who are still active as investment managers , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
as christian <unk> got changed , and <unk> were created out of <unk> , batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada , also going back to the bible .
the first is the fall of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> in europe .
now the main bad guy , <unk> , does not want these stones to update , so he &apos;s trying to get them to stop <unk> .
and this is one of my favorites , <unk> from yemen .
&quot; so when &apos;s the article coming out ? &quot;
<unk> : there must be something we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group <unk> itself as extreme .
<unk> <unk> : superheroes inspired by islam
let &apos;s take a look .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i discovered an odd thing about myself .
so , you have the eye , and then you drop in the concepts .
but of course , china has an enormous population .
but what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression .
it &apos;s even fun to engage with them because it &apos;s visual .
the eden top note is named after the eden project in the u.k.
why doesn &apos;t it smell of potatoes or <unk> ? well , there are really two theories .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a <unk> which has exactly the same vibration .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
they made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin .
this is a real thing .
there are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention .
and she sort of , she had no idea of the context in which she &apos;d landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye to anybody , not my mother , my father , my sisters , my brothers , my aunts , my uncles , my cousins , my grandparents , nobody .
i &apos;m reporting back . i &apos;m reporting back simply to say that when i left the children &apos;s home i had two things that i wanted to do . one was to find my family , and the other was to write poetry .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you .
he had a <unk> and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female , and probably much smaller , members of his family group , to have got to where he did in life , age 12 .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation , or is it going to lead us to being the <unk> hominid species on planet earth ?
but will we do that , or will we just let nature take its course ?
and one day , a couple of weeks later , it might have been maybe a year later , i was in the art store with my kids , and i was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day .
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
my preference is about 70 <unk> of this -- <unk> black auto primer .
you want to know how obsessed i am . this project &apos;s only for me , and yet i went so far as to buy on ebay a 1941 chinese san <unk> newspaper , in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
as we made our way up towards the spectacular blue mountains west of sydney , it was the perfect autumn day : sunshine , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no . it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you walk again , it will be with <unk> and a walking frame . &quot;
i remember dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair , wrapped in a plaster body cast , and feeling the sun on my face for the first time .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;re going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her . &quot;
she passed me the phone book , i rang up the flying school , i made a booking , said i &apos;d like to make a booking to come out for a flight .
and i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never been up .
i &apos;m in that world , but i work purely instinctively .
that is like an <unk> <unk> flowing through a richard serra .
how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
in his day , he was the highest taxpayer in britain .
i &apos;m looking at <unk> structures and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture <unk> , but that &apos;s not the end motivation . it &apos;s made from aluminum , as opposed to <unk> , and it &apos;s grown .
that &apos;s the car of the future . it &apos;s a water droplet .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s made from kevlar .
right after i completed my ph.d. , i was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration .
there was another one of those <unk> <unk> .
so it uses its red bioluminescence like a <unk> &apos;s scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .
so they can use it for finding food , for attracting mates .
and i defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology .
it &apos;s a magical place .
and i began the journey of <unk> the value of sleep .
and it was on june 5 , 1995 , that i heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck .
and here are the ducks again .
after winning this prize , my life changed .
another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds .
so , for example , if i have , like — this is the sound of purple .
so depending on how i display it , i can hear and i can compose music with food .
one of them is martin luther king &apos;s &quot; i have a dream , &quot; and the other one is hitler .
indeed , there is this phenomenon now where the general <unk> are becoming the ceos .
you wouldn &apos;t want to say something <unk> that might be used against you . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when the teacher tries to <unk> order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
it turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure .
because life is complex , and here is the hardest and biggest change : we have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law .
a free society requires red lights and green lights , otherwise it soon descends into gridlock .
impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees .
well if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler .
he had a pretty <unk> job .
he did after all have a toy gun .
but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they <unk> professional activity , and they <unk> professional activity in two senses .
so <unk> <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine any <unk> outlaw sustaining that for an <unk> period of time .
why has the idea spread ?
people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
and it was an extraordinary time , and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we -- that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing .
this was bert the turtle .
the main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality .
so , what i &apos;d like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium .
what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon ?
we &apos;re coming down , and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here , in the financial district .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
this was sent to me by somebody who is an <unk> of civil defense procedures , but the fact of the matter is that america &apos;s gone through a very hard time .
there &apos;s a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing , that actually have made the problem worse .
we can show results . we can make things better .
how do we tap into this ?
it &apos;s profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
imagine if we could do that , because if we could do it , we could scale .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
maybe i can cut there , see the brain , and i can change my cut .
let me zoom in .
i &apos;d like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to june 24 , <unk> .
i &apos;m sure we could all be that productive without facebook or twitter to take up our time .
they also <unk> lobbied the british government for the money to build babbage &apos;s engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society .
these grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research , but they also encouraged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one <unk> question .
i &apos;m going to tell you about how i learned something about life .
so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things -- so this particular person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and for those of you who aren &apos;t old enough , you have no idea how this infection was working -- namely , through these floppy disks .
there &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys .
anywhere there &apos;s life , you &apos;re going to have this distribution , as opposed to that distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you lost your keys here ? &quot;
this is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of zambia from a few years ago that i participated in .
as you can see , bruce willis had a lot more hair back then .
so you could be talking about 10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000 dollars if i actually had the time or it fit my schedule and i wasn &apos;t on vacation .
instead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices , let &apos;s create software that lets them do it themselves with no training and without me being involved ?
that &apos;s less than i used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation .
so , then , we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life , or in the balloon , we have to change altitude .
this can be in spirituality .
and this is why you need <unk> .
i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel <unk> .
i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities , that can talk to students , talk to politicians during the flight , and really make it a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the goal now ?
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
now , you need a laptop .
anyway , we found africa to be a magical place .
the next thing i &apos;d like to be clear about is what this problem is , and what this problem isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s crazy , really , when you think about it .
and let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye , look across the ocean to africa , and say this , and mean it : we do not have to stand for this .
it is a pain in the <unk> .
this year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the g8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
people are starting to figure this out .
and with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , data , and other groups , have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that &apos;s out there from hollywood into the <unk> of america .
: one by one they step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a <unk> , and lives are saved .
the idea that the internet , which changed all of our lives , can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog , let alone digital -- blows my mind .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called bouba , and which is called kiki .
now , unless you &apos;re a prison guard , the sentence &quot; some jobs are jails &quot; is literally false .
whenever we solve a problem , or make a discovery , we compare what we know with what we don &apos;t know .
nadia <unk> : well , i &apos;m glad to be here .
and yet , you yourself defy all those <unk> .
pm : i don &apos;t think so .
so how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you ?
some of my reporters were arrested .
and it definitely does give a different image of yemen .
my heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt , like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , you &apos;ll probably end up in the <unk> .
but soon i was showing signs of <unk> failure , and i had to return to sea level , doing so knowing that i probably would never see my home again .
i was sitting there kind of <unk> talking with the head transplant surgeon , and i asked him if i needed a transplant , what i could do to prepare .
i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the u.s.
what &apos;s interesting is , in fact , the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the breast cancer <unk> , now sells us the <unk> -- the exact same company .
but we also start out as aquatic organisms .
what would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure today , i had some <unk> , some artificial <unk> and some bisphenol a.
the problem is , in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see that connection .
here is the accumulation at <unk> creek next to the l.a. airport .
i offered five cents each for bottle caps .
the throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
you can see the range of the coast redwoods . it &apos;s here , in red .
you &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant , and most of the organism is overhead , unseen .
looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us .
redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called <unk> .
flying <unk> , just as in a cathedral , help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time .
it &apos;s absolutely heartbreaking to see .
but lately , the doors of the palace have been <unk> open , and the walls are coming down .
that &apos;s 25 years ago .
for example , let &apos;s go with the <unk> virus first .
so how do these guys then <unk> those infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
you &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a web address : <unk> / d / <unk> and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the mercedes is <unk> .
we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
but i &apos;m not engaged in doing that .
that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .
why should we believe what he &apos;s saying ? &quot;
what &apos;s its future ?
that power disappears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
it would be a good thing if people paid more attention , took seriously , and engaged in the same sorts of calculations , because it would change things . but it would change things in two beneficial ways .
this means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file , plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality .
and jill and kevin , the happy couple , they came back from their <unk> and found that their video had gone crazy viral .
thank you .
you will go far away .
it &apos;s what he had been trained to do since he was five years old .
i am grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau who taught me how to navigate .
what is it that drives you in your life today ? not 10 years ago .
how do you take what you &apos;re dreaming of and make it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t have the ...
in this second , consciously or unconsciously , the minute you decide to focus on something you &apos;ve got to give it a meaning , and whatever that meaning is produces emotion .
have you ever done something , after you did it , you go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
bored out of your minds . so , god , in her infinite wisdom , gave us a second human need , which is uncertainty .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s true -- we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayer , through walking in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through them because i &apos;m done . the last piece is emotion .
jewish man with family in the occupied territory , someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and made it very clear .
instead , i &apos;m really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories , people all around the world .
the color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy , positive feelings are brightly colored .
we see , &quot; i feel like i have been at a computer all day . &quot;
and then if i go over here , the list begins to scroll , and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected .
the ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule .
it &apos;s called universe : revealing our modern mythology .
we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband &apos;s coffin .
and there are also quotes that you can see , if you &apos;re interested in reading about quotes on climate change .
and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way .
tens of thousands of members now in almost 100 countries around the world .
you just need to step outside , pay attention to what &apos;s so commonplace , so everyday , so mundane that everybody else misses it .
so keep looking up , marvel at the ephemeral beauty , and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds .
they would put up 25,000 images , they would go like this , &quot; <unk> , okay , okay .
and you know , going back maybe 10 years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine .
so this is from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see that knife went through the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step motors inside of the pen .
now this is really an interesting project .
so he &apos;s going like this .
so , some very talented people .
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
so it &apos;s not the final story , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
as i pursued my career , something was always <unk> away inside me .
and in 2001 , i took a research leave to visit them .
and we got lots of <unk> .
so here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004 .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
each will have a pan-african student body , but specialize in a different area of science .
i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up in accra , and it was a really cool device .
he studies the brain using mri , and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned .
and i &apos;ll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really <unk> from that .
the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
so , in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so , now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call these the <unk> <unk> of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show <unk> .
so , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than <unk> else .
and that buys us about a factor of 20 .
so , there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
it pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between <unk> and cars and fire <unk> .
so for example , in the 11th century , people liked pieces that ended like this .
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big &apos; what &apos; was to praise god .
and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible .
the question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and emotion through time
so this is the dawn of the new age of kites .
by 1945 , they were making 100,000 .
so , i &apos;ll talk about musical composition , even though i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , yay !
but recently , i &apos;ve become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds , because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool .
well , i think it &apos;s the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
we &apos;re getting great talks back from them .
here , let me introduce you to sam <unk> .
but even leaving the screen out of it , there &apos;s still a lot more being transferred than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
how web video powers global innovation
first of all , i must , as a speaker , provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you , instead of saying what i can &apos;t have .
i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible tedtalks .
well , you can &apos;t compare oranges to <unk> .
they keep you alive . it gives them the pie , it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we &apos;ve called a superpower .
these kinds of probes exploit it . okay ?
and someone asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
thought he could turn back the waves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the waves .
well , i think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference : in transparency , in greater choice and in accountability , in giving us that genuine people power .
how do you do it ?
my bridge coach , sharon <unk> , says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else &apos;s in the world .
eleven out of 14 .
and second , teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools , because they pointed to specific places where they can improve .
<unk> , everybody , have a great weekend .
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now , you might be asking yourself , &quot; well , you know , what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you had spaces like this all over the world , it could really change the perception of who &apos;s allowed to do biotech .
the kingdom argues that its laws allow it to <unk> or <unk> foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state .
these laws fly in the face of science , and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion .
why are you pregnant when you are living positive ? &quot;
in fact , one in every 10 new infections of hiv is among people who inject drugs .
so for example , outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police <unk> or abuse or arbitrary arrest .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
the office building is basically obsolete for doing private work .
they took the elevated highway , they got rid of it , they reclaimed the street , the river down below , below the street , and you can go from one end of seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars .
people say , we don &apos;t really want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment .
we think workplaces should be shared .
you get gallons of oil from their liver .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks in this period , literally just by <unk> a manila rope off the tip of <unk> bay at achill island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun , plus water temperature and depth .
if you look at <unk> diversity , which is more genetics that are passed on through parents , you can see that basking sharks , if you look at the first study , was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species .
so <unk> did a <unk> study and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
and that was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , you know , i can build on this . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it , we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female .
so i decided to go there and act as a seller .
their bodies are chopped up with <unk> and are supposed to be used for some <unk> or some <unk> for people to get money -- or so many , many stories people would tell about it .
i have not done any business with anybody .
my kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries , but i can tell you , it works in my part of the continent of africa , because usually , when people talk about corruption , they ask , &quot; where is the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the <unk> of punk music .
i wouldn &apos;t have qualified as <unk> .
and had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
at some point i realized that my mission to photograph &quot; gays &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
at the very least i hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
one , the world is , was , will always be filled with good and evil , because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition .
and thirdly , i had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took .
there are three ways . the main way is -- it &apos;s called <unk> .
this is stanley milgram , little jewish kid from the bronx , and he asked the question , &quot; could the holocaust happen here , now ? &quot;
&quot; sir , who &apos;s going to be responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
interestingly , stanley milgram and i were in the same high school class in james <unk> in the bronx , 1954 .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of others . <unk> of self .
<unk> <unk> says , &quot; the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being . &quot;
and i ended the study the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anyone could do , &quot; no big deal to jump on the tracks .
this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to <unk> .
we have selves .
but on my left retina there is a bump , which is marked there by the red arrow .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
i promise not to say anything about this , except this is to frighten you .
and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory , reasoning , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop -- and <unk> hill .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself , because i think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
we don &apos;t want one hero .
you may have guessed by now , i did not light myself on fire .
she was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating <unk> , she was <unk> friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s self-awareness that separates homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind .
this is actually a brainwave sensor that &apos;s reading the electrical activity of my brain as i give this talk .
we brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind , like thought-controlled home appliances or a levitating chair .
the headset connects wirelessly to an ipad or a smartphone .
the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will <unk> many of the damaging and widespread social <unk> that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with .
they understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing , evolving and growing .
and he said , &quot; so what are you going to do to celebrate ? &quot;
my ability and my potential .
and temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
and that eye specialist , he didn &apos;t bother testing my eyes .
and i went on a run that i know so well .
and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
because i wasn &apos;t believing in me , really me , all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us .
this is me , all of me .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but one of them makes you feel great and the other one , with just a small change of posture , makes you feel terrible .
but i think there &apos;s another debate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our tax money .
for <unk> percent of this money you could have put wifi on the trains , which wouldn &apos;t have reduced the duration of the journey , but would have improved its enjoyment and its <unk> far more .
i &apos;m not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other .
sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
i think the danger we have in today &apos;s world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology .
the average answer , or the <unk> answer would have been 50 to 60 percent .
trusted not to hurt themselves , and trusted not to hurt others .
yay !
these are stories from 20 , 30 years ago .
but that wouldn &apos;t mean that i had a <unk> coin .
and this is not a difficult problem to fix .
but this our containment of the visible universe .
thank you .
we &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effects with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using hyperscore .
and it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
dan <unk> : hello . my name is dan <unk> . i am 34 years old and i have cerebral palsy .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely composed by dan in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s do a dry run .
there is first , the present self .
i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars .
and so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot;
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
the last thing i &apos;ll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with hal <unk> , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , bill sharpe .
and what &apos;s nice about it is it &apos;s not something that <unk> people actually , because as one face smiles , the other face <unk> .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the <unk> .
x is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in spanish .
it isn &apos;t surprising , then , that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness , the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at <unk> and made this iconic declaration .
what is this about ?
and if you look at the species level , you saw about fish .
but of course , if you look at exactly what those profits are , almost 8,000 of those dollars are , in fact , subsidies .
that was in the early <unk> when india was going <unk> about gdp growth as the means forward -- looking at china with its <unk> <unk> of eight , nine , 10 percent and wondering , why can we do the same ?
now that &apos;s not a happy situation for them , but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say , &quot; here &apos;s what we are measuring .
green carbon , which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions , and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
he loved to win .
i didn &apos;t know what those things meant , neither did dick -- neither did sydney for that matter .
i also liked the kind of intellectual macho games .
and he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move during the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they &apos;re moving .
we stripped out all the <unk> and <unk> paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell .
a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for airstream .
so if you &apos;re thinking about sending your kid to tinkering school , they do come back bruised , scraped and bloody .
you know , let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that you can &apos;t get out of playing with <unk> the explorer toys .
next time you &apos;re about to throw out an appliance , don &apos;t throw it out .
i think that &apos;s it . that &apos;s number five and a half . ok .
so here &apos;s my wife &apos;s bad knee on the left , and her just <unk> now four months later in aspen , and doing well .
what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement , not just the parts ?
this is one of the seven surviving <unk> that was not launched into space .
and so all of western europe started buying printing presses in <unk> -- to print out thousands , and then hundreds of thousands , and then ultimately millions of single , small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven .
how do we create ?
and we never think about the hidden connection .
when edison invented the light bulb , pretty much looked like this .
you have to be kind of smart , and though i did not graduate from college doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .
they have literally beat a path to our door .
when you listen to stereo on your home system , your both ears hear both speakers .
we &apos;ve got a problem with the antenna ringing .
thank you once again .
so for this reason , i &apos;m particularly drawn to systems and patterns .
recently , i &apos;ve also made some rather <unk> baroque borders out of <unk> pasta .
and i drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and <unk> it and signed it and sent it out .
i &apos;m certain i can see you <unk> .
and i actually really feel that it &apos;s worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .
also , when we think about future technologies , we start with the beginning of earth .
and you flip it over , and it &apos;s the amino acids with the ph at which they have different charges .
and through a process of selection evolution , you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you &apos;d like it to do , like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .
in this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
if you ask people the question : where do you really need to go when you need to get something done ?
i sat at my desk . i used my expensive computer .
and what ends up happening -- sometimes you might have days like this where you wake up at eight in the morning , or seven in the morning , or whenever you get up , and you &apos;re like , man , i didn &apos;t really sleep very well .
at the office , most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary .
we all know this to be true , and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees .
so meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today , especially to offices .
so maybe it &apos;s every other week , or every week , once a week , <unk> no one can talk to each other .
and you know , to be honest , i &apos;ve been doing this for seven years , and i haven &apos;t got a clue what the future is going to be like .
but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys , money and , if they own one , a mobile phone .
but -- and it &apos;s a pretty big but -- we forget .
so , let me give you an example of delegation in practice , right .
you take a 10 or 20 percent commission , and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission , and passes the rest over to you in cash .
it challenges the norms .
and he , somehow , has the appreciation of the values of <unk> .
we &apos;re seeing , along with that proliferation of mobile devices , an expectation of availability .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what were we just talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research that shows how adopting healthy lifestyle habits can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live healthier , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase .
until i tell you who said it .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
when i went home that night after getting my tattoo , i basically stayed up all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s also a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; reply all &quot; regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .
none in india . there are now at least a half a million active .
and it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
and so we have set about doing that .
listen to this : less than <unk> of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise <unk> on treatment .
it &apos;s worth a try and i believe it would succeed .
the desks are not square .
when the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the green school .
local balinese women cook the food on sawdust <unk> using secrets that only their grandmothers know .
we need someone to come and study it .
green school is a model we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal cords were still healthy and <unk> .
then apple released the alex voice , which was the best i &apos;d heard .
there was a reason for that ; it was me .
the flow isn &apos;t natural .
but that &apos;s not the point .
for me , the internet began as a useful tool and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence .
it is human nature to look away from illness .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the turing test .
before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , &quot; what are you doing for a living ? &quot;
we treated two pages , both spreads , as a one page , because that &apos;s how readers perceive it .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
and my grandmother one time said , &quot; no , look , you &apos;re not going to run away .
it <unk> , and horrible things were happening to me .
everybody lost faith in me being able to recover .
so they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture -- gave me pots and <unk> , blankets , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far that street is and you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going straight and you hear cars <unk> back and forth , and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation .
i thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends .
for example , molecular structure .
and he took me up to the temples in <unk> .
can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t flip it because i &apos;ve put a little twist on it , haven &apos;t i ?
if i do one magic trick move followed by another , the combination is a third magic trick move .
now , galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact .
and it &apos;s a symmetry we call <unk> .
rather than you all shouting out , i want you to count how many digits there are in that number . okay ?
i need your <unk> . symmetrical objects generally -- spell it for me .
first of all , worse nutrition , maybe shorter life spans .
thomas edison would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today .
penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even by 1940 , no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced .
it was the origin of the xerox <unk> , which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year .
the message , then , for me , about unintended consequences is chaos happens ; let &apos;s make better use of it .
it works on every computer , every web browser , or minus , minus , minus to get smaller again .
also , don &apos;t delete what you &apos;ve highlighted .
and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk .
so one thing we have for that is like a grid align , kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop . things are kind of grid aligned .
now , i use my music to reach people &apos;s hearts and have found there are no boundaries .
but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth , and it &apos;s with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on wall street now , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find it here : this book about flies that you may have been looking at on amazon .
these aren &apos;t financial stats ; this is culture .
you can take it really , really far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
let &apos;s hear it . shake . louder .
let me tell you a secret .
so , <unk> intersections , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there &apos;s an excessive proliferation of them .
the answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely .
and warren buffet had recommended i do that -- being honest about what was going well , what wasn &apos;t , and making it kind of an annual thing .
in fact , if we look at the genetic code , it &apos;s the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths .
it means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
but that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
not only has that been <unk> it &apos;s getting weaker .
a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class -- based on test scores -- by over 10 percent in a single year .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and in fact , these free courses could not only be available just on the internet , but you could make it so that dvds were always available , and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers .
everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how , as a young artist , he thought he was a painter , and he lived in florence after graduate school .
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night .
and my mom and my dad were amazing . they were like , &apos; look , we know you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful .
this is mass general in boston .
the pathologist takes that sample , freezes it , cuts it , looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room .
so here in this situation , if you make a solution full of this <unk> molecule along with the dye , which is shown in green , and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer , normal tissue can &apos;t cut it .
but when <unk> lymph node came into our treatment protocol , the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer .
nerves , if they are injured , can cause paralysis , can cause pain .
when we put these two probes together ...
we know that this can be done and we &apos;re committed to doing it .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .
and early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004 , we gave it a try , and it worked on the first try .
now we &apos;ve shown that a brief activation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
okay , there it goes . right now .
i wanted to close with one story , which we think could potentially be a clinical application .
and now you can see , the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again .
buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems .
and when you &apos;re outdoors , that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
and obviously i &apos;m physically a very strong person , as you can tell -- -- so i wasn &apos;t worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks .
same thing to the question of , who was keeping the streets alive <unk> / 11 in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
and one of the things that i experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically , you take an abstract term , and you search google for that term , and then you search the results that you get back for somebody &apos;s name .
that &apos;s britney spears . i mean , you know , ok , interesting .
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
what was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now <unk> .
made in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members &apos; grandparents .
was the tale told well ?
we honor reading , why not honor watching with the same passion ?
it comes in california with a warning -- &quot; this product contains chemicals known by the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm . &quot;
so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change , which requires humility . and in my business as an architect , it &apos;s unfortunate the word &quot; humility &quot; and the word &quot; architect &quot; have not appeared in the same paragraph since &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we ran out of stones . &quot;
and this might have worked in berlin , but we built it in houston , and the windows are all closed . and with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use , this is actually a vertical gas chamber .
now if we look at the word &quot; competition , &quot; i &apos;m sure most of you &apos;ve used it .
we have since <unk> the <unk> most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we &apos;re releasing this database into the public in six weeks .
and we now have <unk> auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
we start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be .
and this here is the infamous nsa data center in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
so for example , they name the collection from microsoft started on september 11 , 2007 , for yahoo on the march 12 , 2008 , and then others : google , facebook , skype , apple and so on .
i &apos;m speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states .
and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
her email was read , and she spoke at the united nations headquarters , and she said , &quot; if there is no right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
most people , when they first look at a fresh human brain , they say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t look what you &apos;re typically looking at when someone shows you a brain . &quot;
and all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through .
and the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes are turned on and at what level they &apos;re turned on .
so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments .
we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a <unk> .
so what can scientists learn about this data ?
they look at their entire genomes , and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked <unk> to genes .
whether or not that &apos;s due to an individual &apos;s genetic background or their experiences , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we just need to do more ?
so here are some other questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , beforehand , everything is the same .
and many experiments have been run , and they all have the same results , so i &apos;m just going to talk to you about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need that kind of information , we need more of it , and then we need to guide policy .
and maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective .
<unk> poverty is more guesswork than science , and lack of data on aid &apos;s impact raises questions about how to provide it . but clark <unk> esther duflo says it &apos;s possible to know which development efforts help and which hurt -- by testing solutions with randomized trials .
so let &apos;s get going because africa , to some degree , is on a turnaround .
and legend has it that alexander <unk> through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa in over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t make a difference . &quot;
so let &apos;s start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data .
i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .
in tanzania last week , we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard .
if i had to ask you , &quot; in 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ? &quot; would egypt come to mind ?
because there are amazing opportunities available .
god is that personal journey we all want to be on , to be inspired , to feel like we &apos;re connected to a universe that celebrates life .
you flip a switch and there is electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they did .
so i &apos;m going to just let it run , so you kind of absorb this sort of thing , and i &apos;ll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time .
precisely .
ok , swap them around , put your right hand up .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no , i &apos;m just still looking at the road .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
they &apos;ve already gone .
kb : how many times did you feel it ?
allow your eyes to close , on five , four , three , two , one .
only when you want the pressure to be released , make an upward gesture , like this , but only when you want the pressure to be released .
do you want to try it ?
in a moment , you &apos;ll feel a certain sensation , ok , and when you feel that sensation , i want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle .
i &apos;ve got one more thing to share with you right now .
you done ?
my hand is at life , here , so -- at risk .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first , keith barry shows us how our brains can fool our bodies -- in a trick that works via <unk> too . then he involves the audience in some jaw-dropping feats of brain magic .
<unk> up .
this isn &apos;t for the one in four . this is for the four in four .
i saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .
baseline levels are near zero , without some stimulus to cause its release .
and they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
we showed that oxytocin <unk> increases generosity in <unk> monetary transfers by 80 percent .
i just found the molecule behind it .
again he asked me , &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot;
so we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
so i think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple , connect us emotionally .
and it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release oxytocin .
in order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
or should they not ?
in an irritated voice , they said , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in english , so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it . &quot;
i decided i would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
what will it be tomorrow ?
we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
i think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
i &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions -- &quot; when did the world begin ? how will it end ? &quot; — to nine-year-olds .
and just one last thing .
maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because i totally lost where this is going .
now <unk> was visiting the local land registry office in uttar pradesh , and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead .
so it &apos;s more <unk> .
it &apos;s common among a privileged class capable of paying numerous <unk> and keeping multiple homes .
following those four children is <unk> &apos;s younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well .
and finally , another individual sat for me from behind and later <unk> his participation , so i had to <unk> him out so he &apos;s <unk> .
children have to leave the orphanage at age 16 , despite the fact that there &apos;s often nowhere for them to go .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career may last a little longer !
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
he would have the sound coming through the <unk> .
or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what blindness is about .
rain . not bad . not bad .
single stroke rolls . so why can &apos;t i then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?
in this <unk> demonstration , deaf <unk> evelyn <unk> illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your <unk> .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the <unk> &apos;s thanksgiving day parade , and rick <unk> pops out , and <unk> millions of people on television .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
cp : you &apos;re lucky that this is not being <unk> to them live right now .
love and peace were mentioned .
cp : yeah . they still didn &apos;t know what to think of that though .
and that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats .
we are extremely <unk> , and unusual in our <unk> approach to life .
basically you &apos;re talking about a country that , when we started working there , did not have container traffic .
that &apos;s an adult <unk> crocodile in its jaws .
paul has never seen a fossil do that .
these are all <unk> animals . there &apos;s a couple of choices .
i became an artist . o.k. , and started drawing .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
except -- bad news for derartu tulu -- some other people had the same idea , including the olympic gold <unk> and paula radcliffe , who is a monster , the fastest woman <unk> in history by far .
you show me a creature with <unk> feet and gills ; somehow water &apos;s involved .
now we &apos;re not using our strength because we are the biggest <unk> in the jungle .
well emily <unk> -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place , in the top 10 , even though she stopped at all the aid stations to <unk> her baby during the race -- and yet , beat <unk> other people .
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s something different .
stop focusing on urban marathons , which , if you do four hours , you suck .
robotics had really been about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and through this technology , being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren &apos;s lives in a way that &apos;s not possible today .
and the third was just a pen and paper log , because that &apos;s the standard intervention you typically get when you start a <unk> program .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
i &apos;m <unk> &apos; , <unk> &apos; , <unk> &apos; real mean , because it ain &apos;t about being heard , just being seen .
took off fast , didn &apos;t get far . i fired , &apos; pow ! &apos; fool fell between two parked cars .
when he was writing a broadway show , i would be outside of the door .
i show a number of photographs and films , but i also make television programs , books and some advertising , all with the same concept .
so , the photograph becomes this <unk> and <unk> desire and <unk> ; what you can &apos;t have , you want more .
how they <unk> their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing , and how that should happen .
it &apos;s highly commercial .
and then you change the photograph he &apos;s shooting at , and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible . .
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
easy to treat . look at the situation in mauritius .
but start telling them , you know , we &apos;re going to try to do it in nigeria -- everyone runs away .
it extends opportunity to the rural centers , and we can use expertise in a very smart way .
prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that .
and we are starting a biomedical engineering program , so that we will train people locally , who can repair that equipment .
autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they duplicated all my projects . that &apos;s the geek side .
now , one of the things i learned very early on because i wasn &apos;t that social , is i had to sell my work , and not myself .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .
in other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
he was now dr. <unk> in the movie .
i did <unk> in college , i was building things , and i also had to learn how to do assignments .
another thing that can be very , very , very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry , and they can teach your kid .
tg : i &apos;m passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place .
it &apos;s an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system , or a digital storytelling tool .
it &apos;s the fifth time i stand on this shore , the cuban shore , looking out at that distant horizon , believing , again , that i &apos;m going to make it all the way across that vast , dangerous wilderness of an ocean .
but it was deeper . it was , how much life is there left ?
and then we kind of have a cardinal rule that i &apos;m never told , really , how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but the truth is , all those <unk> that i had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation , it wasn &apos;t like that .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
and perhaps most tragically , he lost his self-worth .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
they had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew . otherwise , you couldn &apos;t get the right kind of argument going .
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence beforehand .
this is a called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing on the right here .
a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ?
don &apos;t try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing , because that doesn &apos;t get you very far .
and anyone who tells you you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t listen to them .
six to nine months at the right time of the year .
but we really made sure we tested those rovers before we got them down -- or that rover -- and made sure that it &apos;s all working well .
so we have a spacecraft which is heading towards mars , called phoenix , and that spacecraft will land 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds from now , so you can adjust your watch .
and that would be bad .
so we are in the process , as we speak , of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars .
and i know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said well , that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags .
well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .
so it &apos;s very much like the cycle on earth except because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have frozen .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
so let &apos;s see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
and this is an example of this paradigm shift .
so imagine we already have wireless scales .
and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as augmented by these sorts of technologies .
but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
through websites like patients like me or managing your data on microsoft <unk> or google health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .
we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
her cats , god knows how many , who must piss on her <unk> -- her landing &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
her crossing the fragmented tiles , <unk> at the step to the street , <unk> , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid some <unk> part of myself would go out of control , and i &apos;d be forever <unk> in the shocking <unk> of her <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> will come out here and shake his <unk> at me .
when we make love , her holding me everywhere all around me , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that shine an <unk> light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act .
in the 1980s , the <unk> of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i &apos;d read lots of books . i studied maps and charts .
i could see myself sticking the flag in a pole , you know -- ah , glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a <unk> .
finally , morning of day 11 , we got the <unk> , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
i knew there was more open water . and i had a secret weapon up my sleeve .
i knew this , but i was expecting something .
this was the view outside my tent when i had this fateful phone call .
and only from the air did i see the big picture .
and they turned around , headed back to the coast , and all five of them died on the return journey .
this is coming from a jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?
one day in <unk> , 3,000 miles off the coast of chile , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater .
but at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up .
they have the same architecture .
now , some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday <unk> , a way of <unk> what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we put it in every sitting room in the arab world -- and internationally , globally , through our english channel .
they have been detached from their people , from the masses , and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other .
i thank you very much .
because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our internet .
and frankie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
so , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big <unk> of the scientific pantheon in the united states , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them .
you can see these horrifying figures from africa .
now , am i saying , &quot; oh , well , great prevention strategy .
ines is a a <unk> <unk> on the streets of <unk> ; she &apos;s a chick with a dick .
she was 105 years old when i took this picture .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
and play a little banjo . let &apos;s do a little <unk> .
we were driving in the car outside of <unk> , texas , where i grew up in the early part of my life .
and mom was just sitting by the car like this .
try this old song with me . i sing : well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
it was originally made by the <unk> brothers , who later on made the <unk> , which is a <unk> instrument with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from .
oh yeah , that &apos;s easier said than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
when drum machines were new , i got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest form of music , the <unk> rhythms , and combine it with the newest technology ?
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
it &apos;s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space , because that &apos;s defined , not with respect to say , where other things are , but with respect to this absolute notion of space , which for newton was god .
and in a relational universe the only possible explanation was , somehow it made itself .
and you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there &apos;s a continual <unk> and give and take , which is politics .
there is a fellow tedster who spoke two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work into three different levels .
and then just leave it all to them .
he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
was not very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers , who all performed there , get their own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
just a bit too ornamental .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead .
but the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased , and , by extension , the deceased &apos;s family .
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
i was planning on finishing on a dance ...
her talk about the aquatic ape , and the link , of course , the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we &apos;re not <unk> and we can swim rather well .
alright gordon , come on , eh .
&quot; and now it &apos;s got a hangover . &quot;
that &apos;s eight years of american history , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that .
and jack nicholson just says , &quot; you make me want to be a better man . &quot;
&quot; make this world a better place , if you can .
so i &apos;ll just give you my message up front : try not to go extinct .
where are all the little ones ? &quot;
so this is where people went astray again .
now as you can imagine , cutting open a leg bone is one thing , but when you go to a museum and say , &quot; you don &apos;t mind if i cut open your dinosaur &apos;s skull do you ? &quot;
and one would think , that should give me a clue .
so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones .
so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grownup triceratops .
it looks like it could still get bigger .
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
so , all the waters of the world are served there , so we thought that , you know , after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water , you could also drink this building .
so , the drill was mounted on this robotic arm .
then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall .
before and after shot .
and this is a guy from salt lake city , this is what they look like out there .
&quot; drawn into this , &quot; like they were seduced into committing an act of violence .
she &apos;s not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female .
by the way , apparently wired took all this to heart .
analyze your news , and speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage like people at the new york times did .
and this particular plant removes <unk> and other volatile chemicals .
m most of the time i spend when i get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen .
and one of the things -- if you remember <unk> rice was at some event and she wore boots , and she got criticized over that .
pm : and did you get <unk> from making that a central <unk> of foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of state , there were only 13 other women foreign ministers .
thank you for joining us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent .
for <unk> like us , that is the <unk> zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i am , by now , sexually aroused by the <unk> of data .
in fact , today in your capital , in difficult times , some who mind the nation &apos;s purse want to cut life-saving programs like the global fund .
in fact , it could save countless lives .
so now , if you take this metaphor &#91; of &#93; genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris anderson is a <unk> artifact , as is jim watson , craig venter , as are all of us .
you &apos;re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high-level language , you &apos;ll describe that cell phone .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure .
so , this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes , ok ?
you zoom in , there are just four dna strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles , if they match .
you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single , tiny , little mutations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger .
and the computations that it uses , they &apos;re molecular computations , and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it , as feynman said , you know , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we envisioned it , we had three key goals : providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully <unk> from its own revenue streams , and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency , irrespective of the capability to pay .
in the modern day world , where time is premium and battle for subsistence is <unk> tough , the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life .
in my last 18 months as a lawyer , battling <unk> and large-scale corruption , including the one perpetrated by india &apos;s biggest corporate <unk> .
sm : well , actually the cost that we <unk> was less than 200 rupees .
so what we &apos;ve got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner .
now often , when we &apos;re faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to simplify it .
so we &apos;re using these network <unk> to find talks that are unique , ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields , ones that are central to their topic , and ones that are really creatively <unk> disparate fields .
no wonder so many of my people spit bars , because the truth is hard to swallow .
the <unk> &apos;s job could just as well be done in a <unk> as in a hospital .
at ted , brilliance is rampant .
how do things like this happen ?
second , no doubt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern american education : scripted , <unk> <unk> .
and they said , &quot; would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? &quot;
one way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
why ? because there happy to be doing something that &apos;s the right thing to do .
bill gates talked about the importance of education and , in particular , the model that kipp was providing : &quot; knowledge is power . &quot;
barry schwartz makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an antidote to a society gone mad with bureaucracy . he argues powerfully that rules often fail us , incentives often <unk> , and practical , everyday wisdom will help rebuild our world .
&quot; oh , by the way dean . it &apos;s going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame -- namely 32 inches from the long finger -- and weigh less than nine pounds . &quot;
it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
and now he &apos;s going to do what darpa asked me for .
&quot; guys , and woman , you &apos;ve given enough .
and it was astounding how positive they are .
he wants to help . he told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies .
how do we get out ?
it can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
ford <unk> . she spread one leg , and then the other .
in london i lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water .
and i was <unk> . in my first attempt to hold my breath i couldn &apos;t even last a minute .
there is depth records , where people go as deep as they can .
he &apos;s six foot four . he &apos;s 160 pounds .
because of the movement i was wasting oxygen .
then his main competitor went out and broke his record .
and there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
at 14 minutes , i had these awful contractions , like this urge to breathe .
as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible .
congratulations . you have now completed setup .
tamara , are you recording ?
even now , man may be <unk> changing the world &apos;s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
first , even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today , global warming would continue .
and then we watched , as one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year , <unk> .
today , there &apos;s another kind of movement . it &apos;s a movement to save the earth .
pharaoh <unk> the fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox .
so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species , as well as our cultures , because of this change .
and if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
the salmon on top is a genetically engineered <unk> salmon , using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat , to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed .
these are really hybrids , not pure animals .
we &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
in other words , that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent .
paul root <unk> : it &apos;s time to question <unk>
if only darwin had nasa .
melanin , in various forms , has probably been on the earth a billion years , and has been recruited over and over again by evolution , as often happens .
and just in the last 5,000 years , in increasing rates , over increasing distances .
evolution helps us .
spread the word .
because old and ancient as it may be , it &apos;s very complicated and it &apos;s very simple , both at the same time .
well , you measure and measure and measure .
so i found myself , in other words , constructing a geometry , a geometry of things which had no geometry .
so it was in <unk> to <unk> , an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world .
long measurements , big brownian motions , <unk> .
and you have the little nonsense which is left .
and that was one of my major discoveries , to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing , more or less .
should it be a <unk> ? should it be a <unk> ?
right ? it needs to be alert , for which caffeine is very good .
anyone ? it &apos;s much more difficult .
and this can happen in the medical domain .
and why not ?
she comes back to the market some months later , when prices are highest , in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice .
and this leads to very high handling costs .
nearly three years ago , i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington and come back to my country of birth , ethiopia , after nearly 30 years abroad .
we &apos;re creating a system that serves all market actors , that creates integrity , trust , efficiency , transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that i have described .
we believe that this initiative requires great political will , and we &apos;ll have to align the financial sector , as well as the <unk> sector , and really even the underlying legal framework .
my response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand , stretching across the desert .
it seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people , and especially in africa and china .
but , one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood .
and , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria , which you &apos;ll never have to pay again , one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars .
in a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands , this could prove disastrous .
the world presented me with options , and i took them .
our goal is a repository of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single burned dvd is effectively a civilization starter kit .
all those things , the eggs , the <unk> , the bacteria , the viruses , all those can travel in one gram of human feces .
it &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
and you might think it &apos;s just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
and she was horrified to get there and find that they didn &apos;t have a toilet .
we &apos;re not going to meet targets , providing people with sanitation at this rate .
those reefs at discovery bay , jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years .
it fed the slaves brought to the <unk> , the song &quot; jamaica farewell &quot; -- &quot; <unk> rice salt fish are nice &quot; -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada .
we &apos;ve managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years .
i have talked about it a million times , but it &apos;s unbelievable .
the other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
that doesn &apos;t sell .
and yet , to the best of our knowledge , we are alone .
what did i see ? stars , satellites , blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk .
and what would be behind those rubber masks , if they were ?
first of all , i was embarrassed because i had not read the novel &quot; dune &quot; at that time .
and it was so successful that they made it into a movie .
now , <unk> is a bustling little city , and to get to the beach , she explained , you would have to take a bus and then a boat .
one of them was named joseph , and he asked me what was i doing , and i explained .
so we &apos;re caught in a kind of trap .
firms produce goods for households -- that &apos;s us -- and provide us with incomes , and that &apos;s even better , because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services .
the savings ratio , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash .
you can hear the five-year-old mind working .
and in the same token , the solution becomes clear , because this isn &apos;t , therefore , about changing human nature .
we have to invest , in fact , in the idea of a meaningful prosperity , providing capabilities for people to flourish .
first of all , economists aren &apos;t supposed to be inspiring , so you may need to work on the tone a little .
i painted it directly on top of the man .
it was about space and light .
this is a photograph from when i visited <unk> bay in alaska in 2002 to watch the minerals management service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice .
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .
and that &apos;s actually very perverse .
and then , of course , there was john d. rockefeller .
it also put in place the national environmental policy act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
if you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three jobs or more , and then they have to really commute .
we need to kind of <unk> this whole thing , and you can find more about this policy .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
and here she relates , in the documentary film &quot; afghan star , &quot; how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole .
i feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .
and there , we sat down , and we did a <unk> about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
this is a state diagram . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
can we get <unk> behavior ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape -- the b -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
this is three minutes of uv light .
and if you &apos;ve seen amy smith , she talks about how you get students at mit to work with communities in haiti .
and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face .
increasingly , we &apos;re realizing that we don &apos;t even need to <unk> an entire city .
okay . i do too .
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ?
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
they like the <unk> .
if not , one or the other needs <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
and now i have income per person on this axis .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
can you see how it &apos;s growing ? and how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in asia ?
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
look here . this is the world .
they get safe water , they get food for the poor , and they get malaria eradicated .
and we have to <unk> the whole way we look at the world .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one superpower .
a lot of you have heard the term &quot; memes . &quot; the evolution of technology , i pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand axe .
the argument i make is basically that , well , non-zero-sum games have always been part of life .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s probably going to get a lot worse -- this capacity -- because of trends in information technology , in technologies that can be used for purposes of <unk> like biotechnology and nanotechnology .
doing the best i can , ok .
&quot; yahweh is our savior &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
we have civil wars only in six countries , which means that the media are covering only six countries .
so , where should we be putting the money ?
none of those countries , including africa &apos;s most successful nation , botswana , has ever met its quota .
in the process , we , the african people , have been <unk> from the policy-making , <unk> , and <unk> implementation process in our countries .
public administration , which is largely <unk> , takes <unk> billion .
we &apos;d like to interview you about that . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
and i believe there are three different -- and i call them different because different interventions build them , it &apos;s possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .
but it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like <unk> <unk> .
and what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set .
i thought , when i first became a therapist 30 years ago , that if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not anxious , not angry , that i &apos;d make them happy .
a polar bear swimming in the arctic , by paul <unk> .
but this <unk> memory , as it &apos;s called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
nick -- the camera , again , an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this .
sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .
we also want to look for solutions .
and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .
thank you .
and , even more importantly , since this is a <unk> process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
emily : image metrics is a <unk> , <unk> animation company .
but finally , i got myself involved .
it has also some beautiful primates .
but i was from the west , working in the east .
everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral , killing animals , the logging <unk> and so on .
that is coltan extraction , gold mining .
one day , we went to meet the chief commander .
the elephant just <unk> and they just got the tusks .
i don &apos;t think that someone may blame google , because it &apos;s doing the right things , even if people like al-qaeda are using google to connect between them .
<unk> <unk> : a hero of the congo forest
we &apos;ve drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies .
you don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
i should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experiments .
democracy does not require perfect equality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life .
takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900 , when the line switches to red .
and we got that gift back in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s when women entered the labor force .
electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
and an amazing fact for <unk> is that in the first half of the 20th century , the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the 19th century .
that was an essay i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b + .
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to <unk> , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
and it &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
and you are noticing it more often .
and i needed to find something historically that would match that .
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
and they have to be in all possibilities , including those i never considered before .
but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
now there are magazines about water .
people are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that &apos;s the big market .
these guys make the <unk> car stereo in the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be <unk> to do this .
so what you need to do is figure out who does care .
nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward , <unk> the past .
the first story that i did for national geographic , where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage , was a story i proposed on <unk> seals .
these are the lions and tigers of the sea .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m somewhat obsessed with sharks -- i wanted to do another , more celebratory , story about sharks , as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .
after i left <unk> , i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .
they also get <unk> in fishing gear .
but when the fish came back and began <unk> and controlling the urchin population , low and behold , kelp forests emerged in shallow water .
she &apos;s now living in the jungle of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , her second son , which , by the way , is also the son of the second orangutan i rescued , <unk> .
this was like a biological desert .
and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out .
so how to break that cycle ?
you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , you won &apos;t have any performance at all .
air humidity is up 10 percent .
so you can actually change the climate .
in north <unk> it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there , so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .
the spiral <unk> that trails a paddle on a <unk> trip .
let me show you one more .
<unk> <unk> is a kinetic sculptor , crafting beautiful pieces that move in the pattern of raindrops falling and waves combining . take nine minutes and be <unk> by his <unk> art -- inspired in equal parts by math and nature .
and every city has its own design .
and 23 years after , they called us to develop -- we &apos;re developing this idea .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the polish park , the japanese square , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
you cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s really a digital computer program running in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn &apos;t imagine doing anything else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers do not wear <unk> .
maybe they go later , not right away .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i blew into it .
but we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model , where each school can be flourishing tomorrow .
so erez and i wanted to know more about that .
the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace .
and she got it , she said , &quot; okay , i see it &apos;s serious .
she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of <unk> .
i got up , made the cup of tea , sat down with it , did it all and i &apos;m here -- still partly paralyzed , but i &apos;m here .
so peace direct gets behind them to do that .
he wrote a book called &quot; from dictatorship to democracy &quot; with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance .
it isn &apos;t some <unk> thing .
in fact , chris was worried and said , &quot; look , don &apos;t show them that slide , because they &apos;re just going to think you &apos;re another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn &apos;t do much .
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive <unk> of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
so i ask , &quot; what would move t , technology , from the <unk> -- call it <unk> -- where it increases impact , to the denominator -- call it <unk> -- where it reduces impact ?
and it has been a powerful marketplace <unk> , increasing sales and profits .
we literally gained market share .
but about five days later back in atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in the california meeting .
you know , frankly it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly <unk> by technology .
and indeed , do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , whenever they call us together , invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity .
the three ahn sisters breathe new life into the piano trio with their passionate <unk> . at tedwomen , they start with the bright and <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; by david <unk> , then play a gorgeous , <unk> version of &quot; oblivion , &quot; by <unk> <unk> .
manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild is named after my neighborhood .
he &apos;s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people .
and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america , which in their mind is kind of the harvard of cooking schools , and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .
what we &apos;ve discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie &apos;s music , and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .
these were children who the whole world had given up on , who were <unk> out of public school , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked out pretty good up to this day .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to record the concert and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and if you ever choose to sell it , you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school . &quot;
and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson , who recorded that album at our school last christmas .
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my big mistake .
he came up to me afterwards , he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s assembled a group of people .
bill <unk> tells a quiet and astonishing tale of redemption through arts , music , and unlikely partnerships .
and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental <unk> out so that we stay healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all participating in making these molecules , the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
so this is just a picture -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> right now , and that &apos;s because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
it &apos;s a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
but when we think about justice , aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and <unk> and recognizing .
what would be your reason ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he put it .
so with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , aristotle has a point .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
so then , what do we do about that ?
i &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
i say that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that this threshold exists , because we don &apos;t get age-related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
none of your media got it right .
we care how we make our profit .
they marched into the center of <unk> , and they put women &apos;s issues onto the agenda .
but i can &apos;t give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that i &apos;ve learned from the economists , the epidemiologists and the environmentalists .
the health argument is a scary one , and you &apos;ve probably heard part of this argument before .
fourteen americans die each day from asthma , three times what it was in the &apos; 90s , and it &apos;s almost all coming from car exhaust .
he apparently had a sense of humor .
politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a &quot; lifestyle choice . &quot;
the second reason is that we killed these things .
so we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
but immediately , the government said , that &apos;s it , let &apos;s get rid of them , and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw .
it is , shortly , going to think it &apos;s got the <unk> tasmanian devil baby in the world , so maybe it &apos;ll need some help to keep it going .
and the key question for me was to ask peter , has it changed ? and he said no .
what we want to look at is &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s this : a healthy , smiling , beautiful african .
but most of all that they are productively engaged in life , and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen .
how do we combine all this ?
we were on the biafran side .
i had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back , find a way to a window .
you know , we have to use it well .
and many times i don &apos;t see africans working with them .
so our problem right now is , how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way ?
you are <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria , with the chair company .
and so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product , i took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process .
and it &apos;s been used since the &apos; 90s to study really complex processes .
i &apos;m going to try to condense this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
so how do you study rap scientifically ?
you &apos;ve got major <unk> activity , which is involved in motor coordination .
i mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
now this is quite time consuming and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
but maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
they go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t have stable power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen , so kids die .
another comment of esther &apos;s was that we react when there &apos;s a tragedy like haiti , but that tragedy is ongoing .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
we have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of madagascar .
your <unk> player has a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yeah !
an interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ; we &apos;ve never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair .
this is the restaurant , acorn house .
if you can see this orange tree , it &apos;s actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and <unk> up .
so , water is a very important aspect .
i &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
the idea is embryonic .
they &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal .
as soon as it touches the water , you should hear a sort of sound of running air .
and as soon as we had these two sequences we thought , if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , could there be even a smaller genome ?
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .
so accuracy is essential .
and the last one is a richard feynman quote : &quot; what i cannot build , i cannot understand . &quot;
but in fact , here in the northwest , we &apos;re living very close to the real <unk> idea of paradise , defined 36 times as &quot; gardens <unk> by running streams . &quot;
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
and that number 72 never appears .
this is the nest of the mature colony , and there &apos;s the nest entrance .
so this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer .
the patrollers -- that &apos;s supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active .
and curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .
and the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there .
but the foragers somehow decide not to come out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that that &apos;s because the longer an ant stays outside , the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change , and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .
they cover the earth , except for antarctica .
so here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil , and the cost annually is three trillion dollars .
and we &apos;re doing it with four percent of the population .
that has nothing to do with it .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
and at the time i went into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars .
why doesn &apos;t that prospect concern you ?
but that only blew out 500 million .
never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else .
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
you had dotcom fever . and you had gold fever .
<unk> life &apos;s an event . announce it to the world .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing <unk> up a light socket .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
basically it &apos;s just like , if you &apos;re my enemy , if you &apos;re my rival -- if you &apos;re not my friend , if you &apos;re not in my family -- i &apos;m much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you .
either way , your fortunes add up to zero . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
any form of interdependence , or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people .
and if you tell them , &quot; well , they think america <unk> them and even wants to dominate them , and they hate america .
most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
openness isn &apos;t the end .
now , the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and it would make you a cancer victim .
what does that mean ?
we found some <unk> material that had the right extracellular matrix in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they got <unk> and on the right , is what we can make in culture .
and of course , we now ask , where do we go now ?
so i &apos;d like to finish with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist caught for <unk> , a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they &apos;ve pulled it from the shelves ; a new york times exposé on fake book reviews .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &apos;re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise .
they had four good friends of a person judge their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone .
they said how big the bathroom was , or they said , you know , here &apos;s how far shopping is from the hotel .
right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
and also you want something that frees your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just <unk> away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn &apos;t really -- there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pressing .
i read &quot; peter and the wolf &quot; with this beautiful band from juilliard .
and anybody who would turn around i would , sort of , make a <unk> for .
and at least , you know , in my case , because if i just do one thing all the time , i don &apos;t know , i get very , very bored . i bore very easily .
i think of myself as a ... i don &apos;t know what i think of myself as .
do you get nervous , <unk> ?
im : are you freaking out ? you look so cute .
and again , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , i just think it &apos;s not boring , right ?
if you &apos;ve ever <unk> your whipped cream , it &apos;s actually buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- where people could be from <unk> , <unk> backgrounds , but all be equal as citizens in a state .
eventually i was detected , of course , in egypt .
this nigerian student studied in london , trained in yemen , <unk> a flight in amsterdam to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground .
<unk> , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia .
what happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal , and that was to remove the leader .
these tools don &apos;t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them .
and because of the social connections , chinese students coming elsewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in china -- there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
and finally the chinese cracked down .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but having considered it all , i &apos;m still going to vote the way i &apos;m going to vote .
it was on my fourth trip to everest that a comet passed over the mountain . <unk> .
this is a view looking up the icefall , the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp .
and this is at camp four .
and there were climbers on that summit ridge .
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers , another climber , had collapsed in the snow and was dead .
it &apos;s so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes .
this climber was snow blind .
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it .
and this is how he &apos;s going to turn thought back into action .
these are <unk> lighting juniper branches .
and the fourth thing , which i believe is most important , is &quot; the ideas that we need to anticipate . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contributing hugely to the society .
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
the third thing is again cities .
the second one is the labor policies that we have , which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies , that 93 percent of indian labor is in the <unk> sector .
therefore when you are a young country , again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don &apos;t create entitlement problems as you grow old .
and you must have a clear strategy which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decided to have the elections once again .
and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : &quot; the government does not know better . &quot;
and basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
<unk> .
now , each of those <unk> would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison .
so david cameron &apos;s put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : invest in social change
i &apos;m working already . &quot;
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ?
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; <unk> , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you guys haven &apos;t figured it out already , my name &apos;s tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> , which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice , and the only thing was my voice .
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice .
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets .
don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can .
on the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
and i will give you several examples .
you see the transducer , the light blue .
and his wife said , &quot; this is the happiest moment of my life . &quot;
many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
and we have <unk> results in breasts .
he can stop the surgery at any moment .
canal street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
and so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible .
and their jokes , much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer , really only work within that aesthetic .
it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time , and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive .
these are the two main sort of binary <unk> within the logic of copyright law .
and i really want to thank <unk> <unk> for making this very fashionable presentation .
one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote <unk> , only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found .
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
and there are actually a number or ancient <unk> in <unk> around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
this is the clonal <unk> bush , which is around 12,000 years old .
it &apos;s my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in <unk> their continued longevity into the foreseeable future .
let &apos;s set it to something else .
twenty years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also building their own mobile phone networks , like this one , which has been deployed in all 31 states of mexico by the <unk> .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have ?
recently , the fbi arrested an al qaeda <unk> in the united states , who was planning on using these <unk> drone aircraft to fly <unk> explosives into government buildings in the united states .
as we &apos;ve seen here , we &apos;re transforming ourselves into cyborgs .
it already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it , but it &apos;s hard to get .
they &apos;re killing so many people they can &apos;t even afford to bury them all in anything but these <unk> graves like this one outside of <unk> juarez .
but on the other hand , i hear people talking about fear , a sense of <unk> .
and tragically , in 1999 , when she was in colombia working with the u <unk> people , focused on preserving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were <unk> and tortured and killed by the farc .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of <unk> than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t see profit as a blunt instrument .
but the whole community , all the different <unk> , including shi <unk> and sunni , would sit together and pray . &quot;
because at the height of the season , at the height of its powers , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it <unk> the world , it reaches to the heavens . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
but here the problem is , one company is making napkin out of cotton . it is working well .
<unk> <unk> : the thing i saw in my wife &apos;s hand , &quot; why are you using that nasty cloth ? &quot;
now 110 countries are accessing it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i &apos;ve been back there ever since , for the last seven years .
and i then went and did a huge amount of training , swimming in icy water , backwards and forwards .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
and my close friend david , he saw the way i was thinking , and he came up to me and he said , &quot; lewis , i &apos;ve known you since you were 18 years old .
and to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extinct .
britain , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
this is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .
now that might be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but i think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that .
very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year .
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .
but i wanted interviews that were different .
in fact , the first person i interviewed was george abbott , who was 97 , and abbott was filled with the life force -- i guess that &apos;s the way i think about it -- filled with it .
we know the great lines , we know the great moments , we know what we &apos;re not going to share , and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this <unk> , but it was a little surprising for the person involved .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . &quot; he said , &quot; i understand that . &quot;
half of her body was <unk> , the other half not .
so this is a newborn intensive care unit in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to make beautiful stuff .
there &apos;s one way to treat jaundice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange <unk> .
it &apos;s not the painting we would have painted , it &apos;s the painting that we actually painted .
another example : again , silly mom .
thank you .
no , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank accounts , on the bank accounts of <unk> , of the president &apos;s ministers , the high officials in the <unk> sectors .
they even applaud it .
most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on .
if you think about going into a restaurant , when you look at the menu , are you expected to order every single thing on the menu ?
and it was the first time i &apos;d ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him .
well , he <unk> his life .
he &apos;s an <unk> french painter best known for his still <unk> , but he did occasionally paint people .
so unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
i first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor .
&quot; congratulations on your upcoming <unk> , james .
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .
i would like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .
for a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of <unk> .
franco <unk> : so many things to say , so little time .
and i think this is really the theme of this session .
franco , you described this as the world &apos;s third largest film industry .
it &apos;s a cd basically . it &apos;s a compact disc .
but here comes the art critic . oh , that was fantastic .
i think this was truly fantastic .
you know , video games can be truly deep even when they &apos;re completely mindless .
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior .
along the way , i &apos;ve had to burn a few chairs . you know ?
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place .
and i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and <unk> things that i used to do .
and it &apos;s one of the nicest pieces i &apos;ve ever made , i think .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife , which i get credit for participating in .
and one day i had a -- oh , well , the other way .
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light <unk> , so it would buckle .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i play <unk> in things like my house .
it &apos;s never been finished .
the dome was a request from the client .
and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it &apos;s 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it .
they call it the plan <unk> .
there it is .
and from the building in the back , you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills .
our client doesn &apos;t want balconies , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape .
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish , and we &apos;re working on that , at the foot of a ritz-carlton tower being done by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can &apos;t we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?
and one of the things that they found was they didn &apos;t burn .
and these are the briquettes that we made .
and he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this were india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward .
there &apos;s a definite difference .
after surgery , everything <unk> .
well that &apos;s not surprising , but we also asked them to judge them on honesty , intelligence , <unk> , violence .
he got married . he had a son called <unk> .
is this business about appearance and <unk> with it a western phenomenon ?
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we &apos;re at and where we &apos;re going .
we can replace the underlying skeletal structure , but we &apos;re still not good at replacing the facial skin .
my thing with school lunch is , it &apos;s a social justice issue .
and then we talk about organic food .
i mean , people toss around sustainability , but we have to figure out what sustainability is .
you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more .
and that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids .
so this is a typical menu .
you know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school .
we need to educate the staff .
that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that &apos;s what the government <unk> for lunch .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day .
when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; their eyes glaze over .
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own <unk> minds -- that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . i &apos;d rather be mystified .
it &apos;s a <unk> documentary on consciousness .
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
how do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
can you get it ? how many of you can &apos;t get it ? that &apos;ll help .
we &apos;re going to start easy . some examples .
jeff hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
and the urban planner in london goes , &quot; what do you mean , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s — i mean , no one is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on january 3 , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm , one of the typical streets , january 2 .
well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
then i have been walking east for 20 years -- from eastern europe to central asia -- through the caucasus mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in <unk> ?
the world was changing .
i was at the office ; my desk was clean ; i had the blue partition carpet on the walls .
and there were actually two of these .
it was really something .
how amazing is that ?
now i want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized it reminded me of google earth , where you can fly to any address .
we are , you are , the most <unk> resource in health care .
so seawater reverse <unk> is a <unk> technology .
so , magnificent creature , isn &apos;t it ?
they do not perceive their environment using sound , and these are the flying <unk> .
and for one year in the u.s. alone , it &apos;s estimated that it &apos;s going to cost 22 billion u.s. dollars , if we remove bats . so indeed , bats then do bring us wealth .
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , i want you to smile . thank you .
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
so , what goes wrong ? why is there this &quot; resource curse , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , &quot; why not try an auction ? it &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
around the world right now , one billion people are trapped in poor or failing countries . how can we help them ? economist paul collier lays out a bold , compassionate plan for closing the gap between rich and poor .
there are no little tanks where we &apos;re making surgeons .
so here &apos;s allan teaching an english-speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
so here &apos;s what we think we want to do : imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously .
fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
fourteen years ago , i first encountered this ordinary material , <unk> , used the same way for centuries .
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
there they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the <unk> of wonder .
and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .
when peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter &apos;s mind taking place .
when you do , what do you want to control ?
and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
now , let me be clear about what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
on the left you have edward <unk> .
we live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be <unk> ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
but again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is the natural enemy , the biologically controlled agent , or the good bug , that we are talking about ?
here we are talking a parasite -- not a <unk> parasite , this is a parasitic wasp , again , two millimeters long , slender , a very quick and sharp <unk> .
and if we spread those minute pirate bugs , the good ones , for example , in a sweet pepper plot , they go to the flowers .
for example , in israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 <unk> in israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced .
and thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .
automotive <unk> is one of my <unk> .
the <unk> rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban <unk> -- that &apos;s what the new yorker really calls for .
her former name was <unk> <unk> , and so that was -- i didn &apos;t have the wit to say , &quot; take the painting . &quot;
or again , the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades , maybe within a decade , of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
they &apos;re at the start of food chains .
in fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there &apos;s meat in there anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests , but there &apos;s a limitation very soon .
and some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
allison hunt : my three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
so he said , &quot; allison , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even when a canadian <unk> the system , they do it in a way that benefits society .
and in this book , little lewis would know the big idea .
this is a rule device . and on the back are some other devices , measuring tools and scales , to be able to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , that &apos;s how the device is used .
there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable .
so , the first robot to talk about is called strider .
this is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall , it &apos;s 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things .
for example , in this case , even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity .
welcome to <unk> , the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .
but the cool part is the user interface .
let &apos;s see how it does . this was our very first trial , and ... spectators : goal !
so , what is the secret of our success ?
but just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
so , education is very important .
it &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
there &apos;s basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor &apos;s degree or higher .
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in bertie county .
so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that &apos;s a homework assignment .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
and i want to invite you now to come along on my journey of <unk> and discovery .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
let &apos;s look at some results .
what we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , i believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels .
so when i heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
it has a very <unk> pediatric <unk> center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the ronald mcdonald charity .
after treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
the answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what i want to show you in the next clip .
i had to have long conversations with my wife .
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
and i heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners , and i figured , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t know about this , but before i judge it , let me go see what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was rolling around , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 <unk> , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designer of them will be at tedmed 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
but identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math .
or about 75,000 jobs .
and another thing about math : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math education , we &apos;re spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand .
people say , &quot; is such and such true ? &quot;
but automation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
all backwards .
but i think we can do both at the same time here .
and one of the reasons it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important to get computers in exams .
it was the winter of 2009 , and i had been blind for about a year .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
similarly , just through the grip of the cane , you can feel <unk> textures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed .
but once i lost my sight and was walking along broadway , i was blessed every block of the way .
if you design a city with the blind in mind , there &apos;ll be jobs , lots of jobs .
to give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , &quot; i think you &apos;re fat . &quot;
and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of -- the ten commandments , love your neighbor , be <unk> and multiply .
you donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
so , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when i came over here , the car didn &apos;t flip over , and i didn &apos;t trip coming up the stairs .
so , this was very inspiring to me .
so if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
so we &apos;ve got that incredible <unk> .
the academics who were <unk> this work thought that that was too <unk> , so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser .
but alex was preparing a little , sort of obscure , <unk> , <unk> film called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to come out from mit and design the interfaces that would appear in that film .
and we &apos;ll perform this <unk> operation because we really love yellow and <unk> on green grass .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explode it .
we &apos;re , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image .
john , thank you for making <unk> real .
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
but here &apos;s the thing : the stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act .
but the group of daycare centers represented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bargain as of right now .
it &apos;s value created by the participants for each other .
and like all good <unk> , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , we moved on , and we started playing <unk> cricket .
india didn &apos;t want to play the t20 world cup .
the other was indian cricket .
this was the new india , wasn &apos;t it ? this was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
we &apos;d all seen matches in <unk> , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : shah <unk> , with the <unk> song , getting the audiences all worked up for <unk> -- not for india , but for <unk> .
could you have imagined that day would come ?
hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket <unk> more time in the business .
and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on leashes .
why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
on the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
let me just give you an example .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more on this . so , you &apos;re saying that our response to terror is , i mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bug ?
there are no guns going off .
and as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people .
<unk> and variations &apos; is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .
and this was the text -- &quot; in words as fashion the same rule will hold / alike fantastic if too new or old / be not the first by whom the new are tried / nor yet the last to lay the old aside . &quot;
and one day i woke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
one is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that i am confident about what i &apos;m doing .
my intent is to have a literary <unk> that explains the poster , in case you don &apos;t get it .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
jews often have an unpleasant <unk> odor .
when the room smelled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
i feel like i &apos;m coming home to talk about what i &apos;ve been away doing for 20 years .
marcus : it feeds my mind and my soul .
<unk> : they suck .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means .
without food -- i was sick .
we don &apos;t need no more trouble get that idiot out !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these children -- it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage , and africa has to live with that .
and throughout the book , there &apos;s over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations .
what is the business here ?
and it didn &apos;t seem , at least , that your sell <unk> , whatever they were , were very big .
so , i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s probably a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i came out of college , i started to try to do things <unk> in southern california , and you got into the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that .
rsw : what &apos;s his schedule on that ?
the mit project -- they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their facilities people to bilbao .
that &apos;s what reminded me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; now what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
walk around for four months with three wishes , and all the ideas will start to percolate up .
and i think one of the things i also wanted to say in my thanks , which i kind of missed , was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in .
but in the meantime , these things are scaling up .
and this is like 10 weeks later , demolished by hand .
you &apos;re seeing the <unk> , the <unk> .
the kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something , and these are called the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredibly massive operation , i think 15,000 workers , five <unk> , and the sixth one &apos;s coming in here .
this floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor .
fifty percent of the world &apos;s computers end up in china to be recycled .
what was unusual , according to stephen , is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .
and wish three is : <unk> film . so i was told i should do one for myself , and i &apos;ve always wanted to actually get involved with doing something .
and it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
now i &apos;m seeing lots of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way , over and over again .
maybe we should look at monkey &apos;s economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do .
here &apos;s mayday . she &apos;s going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food .
she &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little <unk> .
so imagine that right now i handed each and every one of you a thousand u.s. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills .
you can either take a risky loss -- so i &apos;ll flip a coin . if it comes up heads , you &apos;re going to actually lose a lot .
if we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market , would they do the same thing as people ?
they guy on the left is a safe loss .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s <unk> .
and here &apos;s the rub .
but the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on earth .
we need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger , and what we &apos;ve been working on is <unk> tall buildings made of wood .
that &apos;s the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year .
bomb blast curtains covered my windows .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely owned by the russian government , has started practicing crowdsourcing , engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations .
we &apos;ve heard talk here at ted about people <unk> and hacking their plants with arduino , and <unk> is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos .
and so , i came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
now that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to give a message , and they each read in their own language a central <unk> , and that was some version of the golden rule : &quot; as you would that others would do unto you , do also unto them . &quot;
to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
there are over 180 <unk> in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> glass fiber .
there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
the bubble is an <unk> .
i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five .
one of the journey that i <unk> when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400 .
as a child so young and tender , words i can &apos;t forget i still remember .
that &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
so my breakfast , my lunch , i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal <unk> <unk> proceeding .
it means that it &apos;s in the low 60 percent .
the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not yet too late .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t remember anything from when i was five years old .
i mean , santa claus knows if you &apos;re naughty or nice , right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so ready to start school , honey . you were so ready . &quot;
and they looked at each other and smiled , like that was the right answer . and then they said , &quot; do you believe that we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this planet ? &quot;
maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we needed to produce a lot of stuff .
but we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resources we use .
but now for the good news !
it might be latin american .
and i think this is where climate change skeptics and <unk> come in .
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago , a big program called the foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge <unk> .
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
as they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was bent over and <unk> , clearly in need . the question is : did they stop to help ?
the word is &quot; <unk> &quot; : it &apos;s a combination of puzzled and pissed off .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called stuff : the hidden life of everyday objects .
since then -- it &apos;s been four decades now -- i &apos;ve trained with the best in the field , performed across the globe , taught young and old alike , created , collaborated , <unk> , and <unk> a rich tapestry of <unk> , achievement and awards .
and i found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath .
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and <unk> him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s what it was like then .
he had put it together , combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he &apos;d put it into this software , which i think his son developed , originally , and produces this wonderful presentation .
well , in those documents , there are little squares , little boxes .
well , i &apos;d like to suggest that rather -- yes , make a beautiful website , who am i to say don &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
you ask the linked data -- which they &apos;ve now put together -- 32 hits , each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at .
and that is what linked data is all about .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
and if we are , are we ready to <unk> , monitor and provide feedback , make sure these promises are really delivering results ?
you just put up , just as one of your numbers there , that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that being a human , the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning .
they said , &quot; of course .
can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ? &quot;
so this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
he &apos;s clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here , because if you think about it , what i &apos;ve been talking about today is this notion -- very <unk> amongst economists -- that most things are very <unk> .
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of .
getting a little more technical now .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it .
and it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
it &apos;s competitive . it &apos;s <unk> .
well , you have pizza when you &apos;re hungry for pizza .
there &apos;s a million different <unk> .
so remember , when we &apos;re thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity , baseball , you &apos;re out .
and it goes like this . it &apos;s by a guy called <unk> chen : &quot; i cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat .
it was : &quot; what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? &quot;
in over 175 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .
they came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
and , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think more men are <unk> than women ? &quot;
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable .
she &apos;s 23 . she &apos;s been on them ever since she was 13 .
it got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another .
they &apos;re going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called &quot; this mortal coil . &quot;
but i actually do .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should be asking ourselves , is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity , at least in most people ?
others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
peter <unk> : is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people &apos;s lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but really as an industry .
well i think you probably already have the picture .
but what really inspires me is what &apos;s going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other .
and we must have an infrastructure that &apos;s designed to support this flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think my mother now thinks that i &apos;m some sort of interior <unk> .
they &apos;ll ask the nurses to input data .
this stuff is really important . this stuff is really vital . &quot;
so , what came out of this ?
and for us , it &apos;s been great because it &apos;s won loads of design awards .
i got infected when i was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of <unk> with me .
it was about all children . so , we were shameless .
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
for our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
but what i never said , and what i &apos;m really going to make the point is , that really , green is cool .
probably summed up in a way by the <unk> or alternative available here , as we generously had gifted at <unk> , the &#91; unclear &#93; , which is a further kind of development -- and again , inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel .
so , if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities , which took 200 years , then that same process is happening in 20 years .
it anticipated change , even though those changes were not known .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
i mean , a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean .
and how do we make more <unk> in this growing world , especially in some of the places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports .
and i think that is the <unk> of this <unk> talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness .
as opposed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk , this is a well-known office , which is the white group .
and behind them , you see that <unk> building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design .
and , i mean , that is quite amazing , what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground .
now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
they are not disturbed anymore .
when our home minister <unk> a few weeks ago a war on one third of india , about 200 districts that he mentioned were <unk> , he missed the point .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home , maybe i saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the honey bee , life would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what has it been used for ? what has it been used for ?
doing what ? breaking stones , digging earth .
that &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
they don &apos;t want <unk> , <unk> outputs .
and that is what <unk> <unk> <unk> has done .
i had to meet my love .
mr. <unk> who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s reassuring .
that &apos;s 3.2 billion people .
or skiing . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things .
so we &apos;ve been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what &apos;s important , and how to apply the technology .
cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they &apos;re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the long-range , high-speed problems .
so if we put this box on here in a few years , could we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ?
implicitly or explicitly , there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade , and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner , or , most likely , both .
you will read that los zetas is this <unk> of <unk> that <unk> the cities that they enter and they silence the press , and this is somewhat true , or mostly true .
and the mexican borders , but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future . and we have a long <unk> .
after it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it &apos;s successful , to rise above a critical mass , a penetration .
but they &apos;re getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implication of it . as they get cheaper , the premium brands , the <unk> and such , are losing market share , and the <unk> , the <unk> , are gaining them .
if you look here , here &apos;s linux in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent .
free is really , you know , the gift of silicon valley to the world .
because of some of technologies we &apos;ve been talking about .
patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life .
and yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations .
during the hurricane , you had <unk> posting about the hurricane on their blog , <unk> it frequently . this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
and just these little things .
and i &apos;ll probably get choked up , because i tend to when i talk about this .
it was fished sustainably till all of time , except for our generation .
and we &apos;ve got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works .
we &apos;d been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to <unk> them .
but that &apos;s about half the size of the biggest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they &apos;re coming together . that could be tuna sex -- and there it is .
they can throw out a target -- it &apos;s a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark , a curious critter that will come right up to our <unk> boat .
and then for sort of an encore from these animals , they &apos;re helping us .
we can save the white shark .
and i don &apos;t think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what i did .
but they said , &quot; okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
now if you go to my bank records , it &apos;ll actually show something from there , so you know that , on may 9th , that i bought $ <unk> in fuel from safeway <unk> .
so i <unk> my life every few moments .
when i first started this project , people were looking at me and saying , &quot; why would you want to tell everybody what you &apos;re doing , where you &apos;re at ?
so it &apos;s just become another day .
now let me show you these heat maps of paris to see how insanely fast it &apos;s growing .
now , i &apos;ve looked at thousands of these marketplaces , and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients .
how do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online ?
i was essentially a ghost in the system .
this site receives five and a half thousand questions a day , and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers .
i want to start though with a paradox .
and there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i &apos;ve just shown you , which i shall use over and over again in the data .
we did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 american states -- asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?
extraordinarily damaging , if you &apos;re talking about using the talents of the population .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
the <unk> judgments increase , the fear of those <unk> judgments .
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .
there &apos;s over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee .
you remember kamal earlier , holding the bamboo staff .
so if you &apos;re wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari , it &apos;s really obvious that you &apos;re wearing a prosthetic limb , and in societies where there &apos;s social stigma around being disabled , people are particularly acute about this .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
in fact , i bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says , &quot; don &apos;t use this <unk> to make juice . &quot;
this is one through 20 . next , &quot; they just give you as many o &apos;s as there are pages .
intense fear <unk> you .
but in fact , if that &apos;s how you always were you &apos;d never get any work done because you &apos;d be working along and say , &quot; oh , i got a new way of doing it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s being safe in the world .
if that amusement park were rusty and falling apart , you &apos;d never go on the ride .
i mean , this is a very small sample ; you should not generalize from it .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization , and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
so , i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world .
what you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer .
natural systems are all self-organizing : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer .
and it &apos;s about <unk> idealism in all of that wreckage .
i bought myself a nice suit and wore <unk> shoes and <unk> in this amazing access i had to world events .
but in 2002 , when my tour came to an end , i decided i wasn &apos;t going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london .
i felt just something &apos;s broken .
and i went through it . i went through those mobs .
and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government .
independent diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world , which is that the world is <unk> .
this is terrible that you don &apos;t consult these people who are actually affected .
that is the politics of the 21st century , and in a way , independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation , that change , that is happening to all of us .
and you say , &quot; hey , could you bring the skim milk ? &quot;
because back to the whole relationship issue , what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you &apos;re not , or it can remind me of why i should love you .
we feel awe , we feel pity .
okay , here we go .
what &apos;s number one ?
no . in the 70s you have the bellwether show &quot; the <unk> woman &quot; that <unk> into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; six million-dollar man &quot; and &quot; charlie &apos;s angels . &quot;
i can vote you off the island .
and so i &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and i come in and i say , &quot; can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot;
the next thing is , that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna .
well , there were a couple of reasons .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &quot; actually . &quot;
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i urge you to join me .
we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .
so many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war .
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
he went on to say that &quot; selfish and <unk> people will not <unk> , and without coherence nothing can be <unk> . &quot;
it takes advantage of the others .
once they were all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside .
it &apos;s about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
jh : thank you .
i soon realized that <unk> didn &apos;t have to be only inside .
and right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of <unk> in his accomplishments , which is another sort of important part about a <unk> .
everything &apos;s gotten simpler in design , and here &apos;s this <unk> airport , and god , i just -- i took a picture .
and &quot; the end of print &quot; is now in its fifth printing .
and so this book is called &quot; probes . &quot; it &apos;s another word for quotes .
this is an experiment , really , for a client , <unk> , where we were taking what was a <unk> sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web .
they thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
article on <unk> ferry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in <unk> .
somebody told me today there was this thing called <unk> , but i don &apos;t know what they are .
that &apos;s pretty high for most occupations .
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
and the last thing , i bring back this <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> . he was the <unk> with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium .
we &apos;ve heard about the japanese giving up guns .
and i think it &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be .
i first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .
he reaches up , takes another <unk> of gravel , releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk ! -- same thing .
but the idea is , we were there for a month and i wanted to <unk> the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them .
and as you go deeper , that lovely , blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .
but down there , there is no sun , there is no photosynthesis ; it &apos;s <unk> environment down there driving it , and it &apos;s all so ephemeral .
but , <unk> , i &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it &apos;s not isolated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
she was a <unk> , but she and i didn &apos;t go out and do <unk> things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me pink outfits .
my parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
cities are the <unk> of civilization .
is edinburgh a horse ?
this is what our whole economy is <unk> upon us , particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner : hockey sticks .
heart rates are slower ; you live longer ; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower , etc .
but most important in this , the <unk> , the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one -- it &apos;s about <unk> to 1.2 .
you grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience .
that &apos;s what we like , hockey sticks .
kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the american government system .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
my students produced these <unk> as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill .
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tuesday , when i asked the students to go to the polls .
and this is just the same .
and you can actually -- -- we won &apos;t get into that .
it &apos;s a wild concept .
and he asked a very important question .
and i &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
you see the cells coming back out .
many of those patients are very severely burned .
the european union , same thing .
and while i don &apos;t have any patents that i &apos;m aware of , you will be meeting a few of my inventions today .
and you know what that means , of course .
and you &apos;ve all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you &apos;re all so young .
thank you everybody .
at my school -- actually i was part of <unk> an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
you know , she was very <unk> , but she was very filled with <unk> , you know .
my daughter -- my daughter wrote that , she told me , &quot; always start your speech with humor . &quot;
i am lesbian . &quot;
i want to hold your hand .
and finally , i get a call last year , and then i have to go up after <unk> <unk> .
and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected , that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all , and maybe engage them to make a difference .
and john said , &quot; bet on good people doing good things .
and there really wasn &apos;t a specific company that was focused on the public interest .
i thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
and one thing that i &apos;ve learned is that there &apos;s never one right way to make change .
so , tell me , how many policemen do you think are on this taxi ? and now ? three .
now , have a look at that . that &apos;s the <unk> machine .
yes , that &apos;s the medical advice the committee chairman says , &quot; yes , i told you , you weren &apos;t going to be able to , you can &apos;t do this , i just know it . &quot;
here is our very first patient , out of intensive care , and just watch that chair , all right ?
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
i have to serve . &quot;
this is in the scottish parliament .
they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
his app wasn &apos;t <unk> until he won the <unk> prize .
but there &apos;s been a lot of debate in tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet , which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services .
rebecca <unk> : let &apos;s take back the internet !
they used to win the gold medals in <unk> and wrestling , every four years in the olympics , and they were the great celebrities of communism , with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it .
the european union , which by now was beginning to <unk> the benefits of globalization , transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history , eventually <unk> some 500 million people .
from 1994 , for seven years , 20 of these boats made the trip across the <unk> , from <unk> to italy , every single night .
let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now .
i would like to introduce you to mr. <unk> .
they affect our bank accounts .
i mean -- if i &apos;m a good <unk> , i &apos;ve got to believe there &apos;s a reason for that .
it made him very unpopular . they didn &apos;t want to go back to square one .
it had been waiting there since 1960 when <unk> hardy , a marine biologist , said , &quot; i think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time . &quot;
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
and then again , there is the fact that we are streamlined .
there was professor <unk> . he &apos;s come over .
so if it &apos;s going to come and it &apos;s going to happen , what &apos;s holding it up ?
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
yeah , i was hanging out with some google guys last night .
you can kind of peer into other people &apos;s lives , and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration from the average user .
this is called &quot; atheist . &quot;
online drawing tools -- you &apos;ve probably seen a lot of them .
performer and web <unk> ze frank delivers a hilarious <unk> <unk> routine , then tells us what he &apos;s seriously passionate about : helping people create and interact using simple , addictive web tools .
and the answer is rather strange .
so , in paragraph number four , you &apos;re going to tell people , &quot; if no one is providing you with this information , let me help . &quot;
and so anytime i talk about what i do , i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter .
so this particular device is called the gut listener .
they &apos;re both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether .
that actually wouldn &apos;t be such a problem , because if we were really all going to die , we would put aside our differences , we &apos;d spend whatever it took , and we &apos;d find a way to deflect them .
this is data from the congressional budget office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended .
it &apos;s a sacred rock , and when people circle something together , they unite , they can trust each other , they become one .
it &apos;s so that the <unk> and the <unk> will know which side to vote for .
so for a lot of reasons , those decades after the second world war were an historically <unk> time .
this is where we are as a country .
we are becoming a nation of just two classes .
now this is a social disaster , and liberals are very concerned about this .
but they don &apos;t exist . so i &apos;m having to make them .
they &apos;ve been in use , in architecture , since ancient times .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
in fact , i &apos;ve managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades , perhaps my <unk> accomplishment .
instead , i &apos;m a <unk> professor of law , psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law , i have many close friends and i have a beloved husband , will , who &apos;s here with us today .
quoting from my writings : &quot; my two classmates , rebel and val , and i had made the date to meet in the law school library on friday night to work on our memo assignment together .
then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps .
i &apos;ve never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view .
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
american prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness , and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment .
so we decided at stanford to build a different self-driving car .
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
in short , there was a lot of water and there weren &apos;t very many people .
now the brewers in montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption , but they still use millions of gallons of water .
he gets paid to leave the water in the stream .
i don &apos;t like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it , so just wanted to acknowledge shows like &quot; mad men , &quot; movies like &quot; <unk> , &quot; whose female characters or protagonists are complex , <unk> .
his name is matthieu ricard .
i know there are other compassionate companies in the world , but google is the place i &apos;m familiar with because i &apos;ve been there for 10 years , so i &apos;ll use google as the case study .
so it turns out that google is a compassionate company , because googlers found compassion to be fun .
i mean , you come to work in the morning , and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india .
it works in three steps .
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too .
but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
i met with one of the development agencies , and they were training <unk> and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
and people often say to me , &quot; you know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you &apos;re reading , there &apos;s something really <unk> and easy .
different parts of the world have a <unk> for different things .
and at the same time , the gorgeous work of <unk> <unk> , who did these beautiful <unk> containers that are made of rice dough .
but it ranged from such items as a complete <unk> equipment to these kind of <unk> straws , so it was really <unk> .
even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint , all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by <unk> <unk> in barcelona .
so what &apos;s image got do with it ?
and they adopted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford .
final story , and i sort of have to speak quickly .
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .
blogging is one way of doing that .
you know , just jump .
and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders .
my cousin ran out of school fees , and she &apos;s really smart .
and if they don &apos;t admit you , they &apos;re the ones who are messed up . &quot;
for years , the country has been divided between politics and religion .
so did our political problems .
<unk> and future leaders have been created .
he was out there in parol delivering a baby .
she is really the center of the health care system .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to every clinic in the world .
now , when i got this , i was -- press caps lock -- absolutely freaked out , okay ?
now riley &apos;s going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here .
and you can see that life expectancy was also short .
lifespan has increased to 78 .
this is the best technology that this region could ever have : desalination .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but you need to share it with the world . okay ?
it seems that generation <unk> is coming .
you have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march , and one idiot or agent <unk> is throwing stones , guess what takes all the cameras ? that one guy .
and then it &apos;s about humor . humor is such a powerful game-changer , and of course it was very big in poland .
well , million dollar question : what will happen in the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk <unk> .
i said , &quot; if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
and i see you .
and everybody just burst into applause , and they were like &quot; yes ! &quot;
i know your dad really wasn &apos;t in luxembourg , he was in sing sing .
the other thing you need to know about shame is it &apos;s absolutely organized by gender .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
we want to be with you and across from you .
and if we now beat up and down ...
if an ant fell into my rice , i couldn &apos;t see that either .
this helped us build a very ethical and very highly <unk> organization and systems that support it .
we kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera , and then every patient gets their <unk> with a doctor .
the revenues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
there are a bit harder issues .
for example , we can augment digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ?
it was as if they couldn &apos;t see me anymore , as if an invisibility <unk> had descended .
and the other thing is , that because nobody &apos;s seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before , and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing , being and knowing , now you have this concept in your mind .
as with bp , the hole does get plugged , at least temporarily , but not before <unk> a tremendous price .
don &apos;t feel ashamed .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system , one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an <unk> supply of new frontiers .
the oil is not liquid .
now , you may have noticed more and more headlines like these .
nice show . man , that was good !
bf : also three with his left .
dh : all right , please stand here in front ...
rw : do i get to hold them ?
dh : just do it juggler boys , you say ?
dh : then here we go .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel .
bf : from six to seven . dh : that &apos;s a world &apos;s record . bf : really ? dh : for us .
he &apos;s less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them .
yet if you did , you would see something very , very similar to this .
this is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated .
so there are plans .
you know the problem ; we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
second romeo and juliet , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and diana , <unk> and <unk> , this is love ! third my greatest fear is ...
13th after seven years now of being in a wheelchair , i &apos;ve done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair .
for generations , we &apos;ve been raising our children , not unlike millions of other species living beside us .
but it is not a normal movie .
but in fact , if i were to place one base on each pixel of this <unk> by 800 resolution screen , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .
unless there &apos;s anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating ?
now think of it , it &apos;s 2016 and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns , but also her personal genome .
and so i urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that &apos;s happening all around you .
and we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the <unk> part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around .
hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future .
in the branch in which the sample radiates , it sets off a trigger that releases poison and schrödinger is dead .
it &apos;s going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what &apos;s ever been done before , so we &apos;re going to get to see some new particles very soon .
the most familiar charge is electric charge .
they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .
this is the way theories of unification work .
it &apos;s considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics .
now , the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life .
and these patterns of points that i &apos;ve shown for you actually represent symmetries of this <unk> object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience .
and we &apos;ve also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of mankind through dna genetic profiling .
in chimpanzee society , we find many , many examples of compassion , <unk> to love and true altruism .
most important of all , i believe , is working with small groups of women , providing them with opportunities for <unk> loans .
and you know the kind i &apos;m talking about . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
see the brick wall as all these problems we &apos;ve inflicted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
and unwanted pregnancies and things like that , which young people listen to better from other youth , rather than adults .
this change , this change . to see change that we must have if we care about the future .
upon working with the plastic , after about the first eight years , some of my work started to <unk> and break down into smaller little bits of plastic .
recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling .
and i &apos;m here to unveil our latest effort , and most successful effort so far , which is still very much a work in process .
this is juan &apos;s book , our previous speaker , which gets a great rating , by the way , at amazon .
at the time , we knew that it was political .
i lost a child when i was 15 , a second child when i was 16 .
i know what it is to suffer , and i feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . &quot;
but what if it wasn &apos;t ?
however , after a few failed prototypes , i finally came up with this , the lifesaver bottle .
put that in there . there we go .
okay . lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .
or we could use one of these .
mao <unk> used to refer to them as the european civil wars , and it &apos;s probably a more accurate way of describing them .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more u.n. institutions .
you &apos;re beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .
but that &apos;s no longer true .
the <unk> of nations , well it &apos;s always existed .
but now one final thing .
but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is , they probably couldn &apos;t tell you .
it reminds me of my college days .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re down to one and half right now .
and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota , where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians .
instead they &apos;re talking about their next nature walk , exchanging recipes , and yes , they pray .
and we managed to boil it down to nine .
they tend to eat a plant-based diet .
in the case of this little example i &apos;m holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that <unk> to my skin by turning on this little light .
so many times , amateurs , not experts , have been the inventors and <unk> of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors , personal computers , airplanes .
back then , computers were these large <unk> only scientists cared about , and no one dreamed of even having one at home .
okay ? and all you have to guide you are your two eyes .
right ? i mean , somebody &apos;s seen him .
so we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling .
and i said , &quot; i can &apos;t take you there , but i can take you into weightlessness into zero-g .
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane .
and you can actually roll some of the pictures now , because i don &apos;t want to look at me on the screen .
no life , from the smallest life to everybody here , would be possible without these little micro-machines .
i <unk> in <unk> . i ate out regularly .
i hadn &apos;t changed . my i.q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
i was a writer .
so basically , no one would accept family planning if their children didn &apos;t survive .
and then we decided , why not get to religion because in the philippines , the catholic church was pretty strong , and thai people were buddhist .
we introduced our first <unk> program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , &quot; we only want to lend to women who practice family planning .
you could call it the coca-cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing .
and then aids education in all schools , starting from university .
and then it says here , with the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t leave home without it . &quot;
those are the things to be provided by the business community .
can you imagine , at every starbucks that you can also get condoms ?
this robot can &apos;t be creepy or uncanny .
so i &apos;ll snap a picture .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see romo doing on the left .
allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
people like all of you in this room .
she walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the african savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . i <unk> behind -- on my <unk> -- holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag .
i have worked with women and for women all my life .
jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth .
she gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop .
women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom .
you don &apos;t want to sell too early , because you miss out on profits , but you don &apos;t want to wait too late to when everyone else sells , triggering a crash .
but you can see those spikes , and they &apos;re there .
so the uninformed player &apos;s challenge is to say , &quot; is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there &apos;s only one or two dollars available to split ? &quot;
next i &apos;m going to introduce you to some relatives .
we can try . we &apos;ll try . maybe we &apos;ll try .
so here are some things we learned today .
it takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west .
so how did a city like this feed itself ?
and then when they hit the eastern end of <unk> , that &apos;s where they were sold , which is why it &apos;s called poultry .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .
<unk> piles of <unk> .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
this is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
and also see that it demands acute intelligence , not just a <unk> feeling .
so in the current state of manufacturing , we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years &#91; of assembly time &#93; , 500,000 to a million parts , fairly complex , new , exciting technologies in steel , concrete , glass .
the next one questions that and looks at passive nature , or passively trying to have <unk> <unk> .
so basically you have a chain of elements .
and when i was in <unk> , wisconsin , i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students .
and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza .
there are unknowns all around us and they &apos;re just waiting to be discovered .
so can we have the lights off , please , so we can see it ?
so we are a chemical scum that is different . this chemical scum has universality .
but i have to tell you -- and sorry , richard -- but i never did like biology field trips much , and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years .
the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .
he &apos;s seen that it &apos;s possible to have a different set of rules , rules where businesses earn a small profit , so they have an incentive to sign up more customers .
both of these countries are dark compared to puerto rico , which has half as many residents as either haiti or the dominican republic .
one of the zones next to hong kong has a city called shenzhen .
people can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it .
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .
how would we write the treaty to do that ?
genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was , by the end of this year , we might have between three and five genomes sequenced ; it &apos;s on the order of several hundred .
when there &apos;s a lot of chlorophyll around , they see a lot of green light .
the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one <unk> parasite ; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around <unk> or so .
it <unk> its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours , after its chromosomes are literally blown apart .
let me just close with ethical and policy studies .
of course it pays , if you like <unk> , to wait .
we &apos;re going to call them &quot; <unk> . &quot; their focus is on what will be .
and it resonated for me . i grew up as a poor kid in the south bronx ghetto , a <unk> family -- everyone lived in the past and present .
well , let &apos;s take science .
and here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula , which is our closest , largest spiral galaxy to the milky way .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s <unk> , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner .
and i can &apos;t tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan &apos;s surface from the probe . and this is what we saw .
ok , so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan , showing these dunes . these are dunes that are 100 meters tall , separated by a few kilometers , and they go on for miles and miles and miles .
right now , earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life .
they would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank .
<unk> : this is a peaceful march .
so we organized a screening .
and it took them four days .
and like the rest of the brain , it &apos;s made of neurons .
and indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it &apos;s exploring around .
and that would be represented by the firing of <unk> cells .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who suffered in a <unk> rights america , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great <unk> of the day .
and why should anyone care ?
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s explore that .
and if you talk about what you believe , you will attract those who believe what you believe .
the reason that person bought the iphone in the first six hours , stood in line for six hours , was because of what they believed about the world , and how they wanted everybody to see them : they were first .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it , and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe .
and , by the way , he gave the &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech , not the &quot; i have a plan &quot; speech .
i &apos;ll never forget , the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons .
and when the office of economic opportunity in washington , d.c. -- which was funding geiger &apos;s clinic -- they were furious .
and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
and they leave with the conviction , the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cured , but by the diseases prevented .
piracy is a very active threat today around the world . this is in the indian ocean .
we caught it with that low-tech raft — — and it was carrying six tons of cocaine .
eighty-five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan .
multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments , this private-public collaboration with security forces , and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way .
which i do .
remember that sort of , um . this is the joke i did when the florida ballot was going around . you know , count the dots for gore ; count the dots for bush ; count &apos; em again ...
the bubbles are the countries .
some countries still had statistics .
but we have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the philippines .
and this changes gradually .
now this looks also like a very good story .
what they earn here -- what number they live on -- is how much they earn per day .
it &apos;s about having food .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us , argentina and mozambique together 50 years ago , and says that mozambique did worse .
governance . to have a government which functions -- that &apos;s what brought california out of the misery of 1850 .
and i &apos;ve shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible .
they &apos;re going to be small .
they said we couldn &apos;t do afghanistan . we did it with ease .
but it &apos;s not a perfect world , and your administration isn &apos;t getting us any closer . &quot;
what would an a to z system look like ?
what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force .
would you like a better system ?
the doctor says , &quot; stop doing that you idiot . &quot;
to attack america is to risk blowing up the world .
you break out that leviathan force only every so often .
here &apos;s the larger point .
air force , strategic <unk> goes both ways .
thomas barnett draws a new map for peace
i don &apos;t want to <unk> you too much .
here &apos;s mount <unk> in the early &apos; 90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic <unk> cloud .
that report that landed on president johnson &apos;s desk when i was two years old -- 1965 .
but let &apos;s say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it &apos;s <unk> heated .
now , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
because under this scenario , we walk further and further away from the current climate .
not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and downsides of it are .
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , <unk> eyes .
positively amazing . here &apos;s two males fighting .
and so i just came , two days ago , from the himalayas to your kind invitation .
but then , if you look in the literature , east and west , you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness .
it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment , a state that actually <unk> and underlies all emotional states , and all the joys and <unk> that can come one &apos;s way .
we know , by experience , that we can be what we call &quot; a little paradise , &quot; and yet , be completely unhappy within .
the mirror allows that , but the mirror is not tainted , is not modified , is not altered by those images .
if you do this again and again , the propensity , the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it .
of course , during the training , we do that with objects .
we are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .
and it &apos;s a tremendous problem for us .
it &apos;s a place worth caring about . it &apos;s well defined .
you can see exactly what went on , three o &apos;clock in the morning at the design meeting .
not just flower beds , not just cartoons of the sierra nevada mountains .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot;
we &apos;re going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the bulgarians would be ashamed of !
one final thing -- i &apos;ve been very disturbed about this for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
we &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
this is some life-support equipment <unk> .
the ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time , allowing it to do new exploration while it &apos;s still achieving geometric <unk> on what it &apos;s gone through already .
you &apos;d pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit .
it says you &apos;re moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
it can be done in seven years with the right backing .
so i suppose you &apos;re not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question .
i mean , there are a few launches you &apos;ve done where the brand maybe hasn &apos;t worked quite as well .
rb : no .
i think , with us , we &apos;ve got a video that shows what you &apos;re up to , and virgin galactic up in the air .
did he tell you to jump , or he just said , &quot; i &apos;m out of here ! &quot; and ...
ok , this isn &apos;t exactly <unk> . ok .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dilemma about how you bring them up .
rb : so our key witness argued that it was actually &quot; never mind the priest , here &apos;s the sex pistols . &quot;
and actually , we &apos;ve had about 15,000 people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go .
no , i just want to live life to its full .
